1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,470
Ahem!

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,860
Hey, everybody, don't ya want
Sensei to come back real soon?!

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,860
Yeah!

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,240
Okay, so that Sensei can come back at any time,

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,040
we're gonna clean this room up good!

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,240
Yeah!

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,490
Almost all of the mess was made by Miwa-chan.

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,290
Don't let her fool you, kids!

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,960
C'mon, hop to it! Do it for Sensei!

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,260
Yeah!

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,960
Wonder when Sensei's comin' back...

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,530
Yeah, when...

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,560
Sensei!

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,130
Hurry on back!

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,490
You Shouldn't Go
Back to the Island

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,990
You Shouldn't Go Back to the Island

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,180
What is this?

18
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,650
Barakamon

19
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,010
You Shouldn't Go
Back to the Island

20
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,310
Mom...

21
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,010
What is the meaning of this?

22
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:42,510
You Shouldn't Go Back to the Island

23
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,590
As you can see,

24
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,360
this is my silent protest to prevent
you from going back to the island.

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,510
"Silent"?!

26
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,160
Since I submitted my calligraphy for the exhibition,

27
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,310
I was thinking of going home to the island.

28
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,270
"Going home"?!

29
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,330
Home is here!

30
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,640
The island is "away"!

31
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,510
You ungrateful son!

32
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,900
Mom, stop!

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,260
No, I won't stop!

34
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,070
I'll keep punching until you say you won't go!

35
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,490
Let's talk it over!

36
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,760
Say it! Punch! Punch!

37
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,760
This actually kind of hurts!

38
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,390
I won't stop until you say it! Punch!

39
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,390
What are you two doing?

40
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,910
Kawafuji-kun is here.

41
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,910
Kawafuji-kun?

42
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,840
Kawafuji!

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,710
Perfect timing!

44
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,970
I just came to report that your work for
the exhibition was delivered safely.

45
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,670
Sorry to interrupt.

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,720
You're not interrupting anything!

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,880
Wanna go eat out?

48
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,180
Are you trying to run, Sei-san?

49
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,410
You can't leave this matter unsettled!

50
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,560
Let's all think about this.

51
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,380
Kawafuji-kun, please help to persuade him.

52
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,730
I was against this from the start.

53
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,320
Back then I had no choice, since my
husband made the decision on his own.

54
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,710
And then, later, I found out

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,700
that you'd fallen ill and gone to the hospital!

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,020
And we were always so careful about
your cat allergy while you were here!

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,250
Well...

58
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,680
Even if I restrain you,
you'll still insist on going, won't you?

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,250
In that case, I won't ask your opinion!

60
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,800
I'll keep you from leaving, even
if I have to resort to house arrest!

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,130
Your mom's really something.

62
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,090
So she's finally putting her foot down.

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,260
Well, I think her argument is sound.

64
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,220
Just give up.

65
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,100
What?! Aren't you on my side?!

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,960
Now that we know you can write
calligraphy even in Tokyo,

67
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,820
I want you working hard instead
of lounging around on the island.

68
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,360
Opposing Faction

69
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,360
Is this the system we're following?

70
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,830
True, it's easy to think of an isolated island
as a backwoods place without electricity.

71
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:30,950
However!

72
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,710
Just by living away from the mainland,
you can find what you need to live!

73
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,840
There, a shut-in like me can live life to the fullest!

74
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,350
I have few friends here, anyway.
All that matters is that I can write calligraphy.

75
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,470
What is this?

76
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,490
Listening to him is making me sad.

77
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,890
You think my worries are only about the land?!

78
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,730
You're mixing with strange people, aren't you?

79
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,910
Your speech and mannerisms have turned crude.

80
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,820
You were never like that before!

81
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,500
Have I really gotten that bad?

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,340
Hmm, not so much bad...

83
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,710
as weird.

84
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,640
Lie down with dogs, and you'll get up with fleas.

85
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,460
Choose your companions more carefully!

86
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,440
"Lie down with dogs, and you'll get up with fleas"...

87
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,750
I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! I'm not!

88
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,130
Yes, you are!

89
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,370
You've been behaving strangely since you returned!

90
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,250
You gorge yourself on pickled vegetables

91
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,490
and say odd words like "komonno" and "nusano"!

92
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,850
I don't say that!

93
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,710
I haven't been influenced at all!

94
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,190
I think you have.

95
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,440
You never used to make such a fuss, Sei-san!

96
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,820
If you're worried about the land or his character,

97
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,510
I don't expect there will be any problems.

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,450
Supporting Faction

99
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,450
Dad, you're following this system, too?

100
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,320
When I was around Seishuu's age,

101
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,290
I also stayed on that island.

102
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,940
I had no issue with the environment.

103
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,940
You lived on the island, too?

104
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,280
If I hadn't been there myself,

105
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,960
I wouldn't have forced you to go.

106
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,510
Hasn't Kido Yuujirou taken good care of you?

107
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,620
Kido...?

108
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,870
The village chief!

109
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,600
Correct.

110
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,210
I believe I have an old album
of photographs from that time.

111
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,240
What?!

112
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,560
Are you planning to tip the odds in your favor?!

113
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,520
I'll only reminisce a little.

114
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,490
I never knew you had old photographs like these.

115
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,930
Seimei-sensei, you look just like Handa here.

116
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,960
My eyes don't look as mean as his.

117
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,380
Here it is.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,880
A photo from when I was on the island.

119
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,280
Whoa, the village chief looks so young!

120
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,480
It was about thirty-five years ago.

121
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,720
I went to catch a "hisan iwo" with Kido.

122
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,160
Hisan iwo!

123
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,850
There it is! "Nusano"!

124
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,530
We caught a hisan iwo, too.

125
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,280
Well, I wouldn't say "caught"...

126
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,180
Oh! Is this the Kinoshita General Store?!

127
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,100
Yes, I believe that was the name.

128
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,410
This is the shopkeeper?

129
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,250
Look how young she is!

130
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,160
She really was pretty.

131
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,980
Oh! This river's still there, too!

132
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,340
Yes, I once hurt myself there.

133
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,240
Me, too! I still have the scar.

134
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,910
That's enough!

135
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,660
All you're talking about is the island!

136
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,420
None of you understand how I feel!

137
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,420
And I've been so worried!

138
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,170
And you're being too irresponsible, Daa-chan!

139
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,470
Your precious son is walking
down the path to ruin here!

140
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,190
"Daa-chan"?

141
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,180
Calm down.

142
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,200
If children grow through
separation from their parents,

143
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,640
then this is for the best.

144
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,270
Aren't you on my side, Daa-chan?!

145
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,770
Mom

146
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,240
You were always frail and sickly.

147
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,770
How could you abandon me
after all I did for you?!

148
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,180
Your ingratitude is like a mountain!

149
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,410
Your mom's a real pain.

150
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,640
How dare you all belittle
a mother's feelings like that?!

151
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,040
She heard me!

152
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,990
Your ingratitude is like the wind!

153
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,940
You don't understand a thing!

154
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,790
Uh, hey! Ma'am, that hurts!

155
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,750
Sorry, Kawafuji-kun.

156
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,940
Looks like I won't be able to go back for a while.

157
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,860
Seishuu...

158
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,130
I may have sent you to the island initially,

159
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,840
but now it's up to you.

160
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,770
You're always free to come home once you're
satisfied with your calligraphy style.

161
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,780
You decide what to do next.

162
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:32,280
I have wished for nothing but the best for Sei-san!

163
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,240
You Shouldn't Go Back to the Island

164
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,260
I've done the calligraphy for the exhibit,

165
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,200
and I've gotten some idea of my direction.

166
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,470
I guess there's no need to
rush back to the island.

167
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,450
If you'll be a shut-in no matter where you are,

168
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,460
it'd be more convenient to stay in Tokyo.

169
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,220
No matter how you look at it, Tokyo is better...

170
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,930
So why am I stressing over it?

171
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,600
Sei-san...

172
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,600
A package arrived for you.

173
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,690
It seems to be from the islanders.

174
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,610
Could this package mean that
they don't want you to return?!

175
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,900
No, they wouldn't do that.

176
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,780
When I was struggling with the exhibition,

177
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,310
I asked them to send some materials I needed.

178
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,780
What's this?

179
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,790
Those guys...

180
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,600
They just packed all kinds of crap in here.

181
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,740
This is bullying!

182
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,010
My son is being bullied!

183
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,750
That's not it!

184
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,500
This must be Naru's.

185
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,050
Who?! Who is this "Naru"?!

186
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,420
She's just a kid!

187
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,180
Dear Sensei,
I won a gold prize.
Next is the prefectural
competition!    Tama

188
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,680
This is...

189
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,010
I got a silver prize.
Curse you, Tama!

190
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,390
They even sent me this stuff.

191
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,980
Sei-san, what is that?

192
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,980
The practice writings from the
kids I was teaching on the island.

193
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,820
Learning From the Past
Class 2-1 Yamamura

194
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,820
They made great progress in
practically no time at all.

195
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,420
If I'd known their penmanship projects
would be graded that soon,

196
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,690
I would've waited to see them before coming here.

197
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,220
I should have received the results with them,

198
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,120
so I could encourage them and celebrate with them.

199
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,580
You Shouldn't Go
Back to the Island

200
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,350
Sei-san...

201
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,670
You Shouldn't Go
Back to the Island

202
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,160
Just do what you want!

203
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,210
Mom, are you going to sulk again?

204
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,350
I'm not sulking!

205
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,970
If they need you there,

206
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,410
then you have to go back, right?

207
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,440
Mom...

208
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,900
Just make sure to call us regularly this time!

209
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,430
Is she... telling me I can go?

210
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,830
Seems that way.

211
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,200
Are you sure about this?

212
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,750
Yes...

213
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,680
That boy honestly wants to
do something for others.

214
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,840
Keeping him longer would
only be selfish on my part.

215
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,710
It isn't just his calligraphy that's matured.

216
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,060
That island is a good place.

217
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,100
Shall we visit there before it gets cold?

218
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,680
Yes.

219
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,870
Ahem!

220
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,430
Not long ago, we received word from
our village phone watchman, Akki.

221
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,700
Today, Sensei is coming back on the evening flight!

222
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,820
Yay!

223
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,670
And so!

224
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,100
Today's the day we're gettin'
this house cleaned up!

225
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,630
Yeah!

226
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,710
Sensei really will be mad if he comes
home to this, so let's do our best!

227
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,300
Boy, this is heavy.

228
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,270
First Sensei leaves the island without warnin',

229
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,020
and now he's comin' back without warnin'.

230
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,340
Are those guys cleanin' the place up right?

231
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,320
tick tick tick tick tick tick

232
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,790
I never imagined we'd waste so much time...

233
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,030
Hey...

234
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,880
Hiro-nii! When did you get here?!

235
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,320
What the heck's this?

236
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,470
Don't even ask!

237
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,280
We learned the hard way it's no fun
once the excitement's worn off!

238
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,390
Don't make us feel worse'n we already do!

239
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,390
Fight!!

240
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,450
I shoulda known you kids couldn't handle it.

241
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,180
Ya ain't cleaned nothin' at all!

242
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,730
Tee-hee!

243
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,020
Don't "tee-hee" me!

244
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,110
Hiro-nii, what are you here for?

245
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,200
Since it's gonna be gettin' cold,

246
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,860
I thought I'd put up the windows at Sensei's place.

247
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,340
Come to think of it, there
ain't no windows here, huh?

248
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,480
We took 'em down and put 'em in our shed

249
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,990
so the glass wouldn't break in a typhoon.

250
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,800
All right, I'll direct everyone, so clean up right!

251
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,090
Aww!

252
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,090
We gotta hurry. Sensei's on his way.

253
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,550
Need               Don't Need
Burnable      Non-burnable

254
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,550
Separate the trash!

255
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,010
Kenta, you sweep up!

256
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,510
Ayup!

257
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,760
You guys wipe down!

258
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,220
Gotou City
Burnable Trash
Collection Bag

259
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,250
The place is lookin' a lot cleaner, Hiro-nii.

260
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,910
I told you guys to work, too!

261
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,220
Don't leave any trash!

262
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,930
Ah, yer inflexible!

263
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,130
This is all for Sensei.

264
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,190
For Sensei, for Sensei!

265
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,150
For Sensei!

266
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,440
For Sensei!

267
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,110
For Sensei!

268
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,740
For Sensei!

269
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,840
It's for Sensei!

270
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,590
Cleaning...

271
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,660
Complete!

272
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,080
There's so much room now!

273
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,250
Now I can make all kinds'a mess in here again!

274
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,980
What worries me is that she'd really do it.

275
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,670
Now we just wait for Sensei to come home!

276
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,130
I can't wait!

277
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,280
Me neither!

278
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,970
Maybe I'll go home and fetch some snacks.

279
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,270
Hiro-nii, go make some food to bring.

280
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,930
Ya really do wanna mess up the room again?

281
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,600
I've arrived.

282
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,780
Fukue Airport

283
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,380
The village chief's supposed to come get me.

284
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,530
I'll probably bump into him if I start walking.

285
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,420
Judging
Room

286
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,420
Seishuu-kun's calligraphy should be soon, right?

287
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,500
Yes.

288
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,270
I haven't seen it yet myself,
so I'm looking forward to it.

289
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,670
Kanzaki-kun's calligraphy was wonderful as well,

290
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,890
so this may be another battle
between the two young rivals.

291
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,870
Rather than focus on the immediate results,

292
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,100
I hope my son will accept them and
look ahead to what comes next.

293
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,750
I believe that Seishuu-kun is behaving
with sufficient thought for the future.

294
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,090
Now that he's had plenty of painful experiences,

295
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,070
he should behave less impulsively from now on.

296
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,580
He should behave less impulsively, huh...

297
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,460
I do hope so...

298
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,540
Village chief... You're still not here...?

299
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh! A vending machine!

300
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,760
Impulse

301
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,220
Painful
Experience

302
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,430
Quick! Just need my wallet...

303
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,470
My money!

304
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,810
Painful
Experience

305
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,860
Got the coins... Now, cold tea...

306
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,440
Cold                         Hot

307
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,270
Uh...

308
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,940
Green
Tea

309
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,690
Hot 'n'
Hearty
Corn

310
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,690
Painful
Experience

311
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,950
Isn't it too early to have winter items?!

312
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,320
Isn't that...

313
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,250
Sensei!

314
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,040
What're ya doin'?

315
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,400
Did you come to pick me up?

316
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,790
Nope, just out fer a drive.

317
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,910
What's the village chief doing?

318
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,440
Sensei.

319
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,970
Wanna hop on?

320
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Come to think of it, this is just
how it was when I first arrived.

321
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,980
So, right about now...

322
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,620
The weather's good today, so it's pretty.

323
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,870
It's just th' ocean. Ain't nothin' special.

324
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,730
Nothing special, huh...

325
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,290
It's best when there's nothing special.

326
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,260
There was a call
from Kawamoto-san.

327
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,390
Hello, this is the Kinoshita General Store.

328
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,970
Oh, Kawafuji-san?

329
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,520
I believe Sensei should already be home...

330
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,500
The village chief was going to—

331
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,870
Sensei, is 'round here fine?

332
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,620
Huh?!

333
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,660
I can't hear you!

334
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,730
'Round here fine by you?

335
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,230
Just a moment, please.

336
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,230
Huh?!

337
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,830
Huh?!

338
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,300
Sensei!

339
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,700
The moment Sensei opens the front door,

340
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,250
we'll give 'im a big cheer!

341
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,860
I'm gonna do a tackle!

342
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,540
All right! Do that!

343
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,790
He's here already?!

344
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,470
Oh, it's just Aki.

345
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,980
What do you mean, "just" me?

346
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,800
Where's Sensei?

347
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,560
Kawafuji-san called for him, so he's at the shop.

348
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,720
It seems the results of that
calligraphy exhibition are out.

349
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,510
Huh, really? That was fast.

350
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,670
This could be bad.

351
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,750
Yeah, really.

352
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,230
He'll be depressed if he got second place again.

353
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
No way.

354
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,570
Sensei's a grown man, so he ain't gonna
say anything to spoil the mood.

355
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,010
You're naïve, Hiro-nii!

356
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,600
You mustn't underestimate Sensei's childishness!

357
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,110
Don't make light of how
mortifyin' second place is!

358
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,060
Hey, everyone! Sensei's comin'!

359
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,790
Huh? Where's my cracker?!

360
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,290
Didn't you have it just now?!

361
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,370
Wait, mine's gone, too!

362
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,780
Where's mine?!

363
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,130
Found 'em!

364
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,530
I'm home...

365
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,290
This ain't no laughin' matter...

366
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,350
That hurt!

367
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,330
Sensei, you all right?

368
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,870
You guys are treating me like this
after I was gone all this time?

369
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,090
Sensei!

370
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,360
Your hands are all sticky!

371
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,380
Looks like he's in a good mood.

372
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,150
In that case, we oughta be fine.

373
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,820
Say, Sensei!

374
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,780
How'd the calligraphy competition go?

375
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,870
Did ya get first place?

376
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,340
Naru! Didn't we tell ya not to ask that?!

377
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,290
It's a very delicate subject!

378
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,230
Did ya?

379
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,460
Sensei, don't worry 'bout it, okay?

380
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,590
Wait, were you guys concerned about
the results of the calligraphy exhibition?

381
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,050
Huh? Did ya place well?

382
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,430
Well, yeah.

383
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,150
Yay! You done it!

384
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,930
Yay!

385
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,930
Thank goodness!

386
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,870
All right!

387
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,490
Come on, cheer up.

388
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,480
The old veterans were just too good this time.

389
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,070
Results

390
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,070
5. Handa Sei
7. Kanzaki Kousuke

391
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,700
You were both out of the running.

392
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,070
They probably didn't want the
youngsters to get swelled heads.

393
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,970
Well, this is more like the result
you should have had the first time.

394
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,290
So you're here, Kawafuji-kun.

395
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,090
Oh, Sensei!

396
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,560
You informed Seishuu of the results?

397
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,690
Yes, he seemed concerned about it.

398
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,670
Do you think that it was
a depressing result for him?

399
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,300
Well, that's hard to say...

400
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Still, this was his first step in
writing with his own calligraphy style.

401
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,810
I look forward to his future work.

402
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,310
Cheers!

403
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,220
So, what kinda calligraphy did ya write, Sensei?

404
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,480
Oh, I'm curious, too.

405
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,000
The theme wasn't anything major.

406
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,990
Quit bein' so coy and just tell us!
Ya placed well, right?

407
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,310
Ya could at least say that much, right?

408
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,590
Right?

409
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,400
Then I'd say,

410
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,460
it's about what's most important to me right now.

411
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,960
Kido Hiroshi     Yamamura Miwa    Kubota Hina

412
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,960
Arai Tamako                Kotoishi Naru

413
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,510
What's most important to you?

414
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,960
Don't tell me it's Hiro-nii!

415
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,960
Ain't it the penmanship we wrote?

416
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,980
No, not that.

417
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,680
Kotoishi
Naru

418
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,290
You guys're so shallow.

419
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,680
People run on food!

420
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,300
Kido            Yamamura                            Kubota
Hiroshi            Miwa                                    Hina

421
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,300
Arai
Tamako

422
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,650
It isn't about food, either.

423
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,300
Then, maybe a rabbit?

424
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,510
What are you talking about, Hina?

425
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,520
I bet it's rhinoceros beetles!

426
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,930
I bet it's a praying mantis!

427
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,270
My bet's on scorpions!

428
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,940
Don't put Sensei on the spot, everyone.

429
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,020
Aki, you're playing the "good boy" role again.

430
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,720
I am not.

431
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,990
You've gone cold, Aki.

432
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,740
Sheesh...

433
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,910
Sensei...

434
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,470
An awful lot's happened,

435
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,870
but it's real fun when we're all together!

436
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,540
When I see you guys having fun
with no thought for anything else,

437
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,840
it has an influence on me, too.

438
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,300
"In-flew-ants"?

439
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,820
It means these are the moments
that are important to me.

440
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,180
Do you understand?

441
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,900
Not really.

442
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,200
Kaette Kite
Urishika

443
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,950
Glad You're Back

444
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,950
Naru

445
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,010
Glad You're Back

446
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,010
Illustration: Tachibana Masaki

447
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,100
Ready, set...

448
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,840
Thank you very much!
