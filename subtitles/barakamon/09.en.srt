00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,930
Naruka Exhibition

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,070
Two more weeks...

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,230
The more impatient I get,

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,780
the harder it is to write well.

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,940
For some reason...

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,160
Since I came to this island, there are times
when I really want to write calligraphy.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,680
I feel something well up,

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,880
and my hands tremble.

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,340
If I only had that hand-trembling feeling now...

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,720
Maybe taking a bath will help my mood.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,430
Tepid

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,430

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,850
Huh?

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,800
It's not catching.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,230
Hot Water

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,230

Reheat
Do Not Heat Empty Tub

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,190
It won't light?

24
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,030
That can't be right!

25
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,940
Hot Water

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,910
No!

30
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,680
Why?!

31
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,690
You're kidding!

32
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,660

Translation:
Almost Got
Badly Hurt

35
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,830
It's broken.

36
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,620
How long before someone can come to repair it?

37
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,200
Let's see...

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Generally a week.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,240
I was afraid of that...

40
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,230
I know!

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,040
For this occasion, wanna try going all-out?

42
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,210
Ta-da!

43
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,230
It's a bath heater!

44
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,700
Burn wood in here, and it'll heat up the bath.

45
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,900
Is this thing really usable?

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,740
You'll be fine!

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,490
My house has a wood-heated
bath, too. They're great!

48
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,280
Uh, but, but but...

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,370
What about firewood?

50
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,990
I don't have any.

51
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,610
There're hills near your house. You're all set!

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,960
You need dry twigs for it to burn.

53
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,600
It's no use.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,750
He's already in gung-ho mode.

55
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,610
I can't say it's too much trouble!

56
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,980
There's more that way!

57
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,440
I have to do this for a week?

58
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,150
Gross!

59
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,280
You...

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,620
I'm sorry, Village Chief!

61
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,580
That should be enough kindling.

62
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,580
Sensei, you ought to find yourself
a wife to manage the fire.

63
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,340
I'd like a gas-heated bath more than a wife.

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,490
You're twenty-three years old.

65
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,260
Don't you have a girlfriend with plans to marry?

66
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,270
No, nobody like that.

67
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,300
Oh, come now!

68
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,990
I've spent my whole life just writing calligraphy.

69
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,330
I guess you could say...

70
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,270
I'm the type who ends up dying alone.

71
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,230
He's not disagreeing with me...

72
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,150
Okay, you can handle the rest.

73
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,980
Say, Miwa-chan.

74
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,590
Isn't that smoke coming from Sensei's house?

75
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,970
You're right.

76
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,170
Is he cooking over a fire?

77
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,630
Would Sensei do that sorta thing?

78
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,870
It must be...

79
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,630
Fire!

80
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,460
It's a bath.

81
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,250
That's it?

82
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,190
Don't go scarin' people, Sensei.

83
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,960
But if it's a bath, relax.

84
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,560
I can do that.

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,470
You know how to do this?

86
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:47,970
Yep!

87
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,260
Whenever Grampa takes a bath,

88
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,850
Enjoying your bath, sir?

89
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,850
I always tend the fire.

90
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,850
Yep!
But put it out
if it gets too big.

91
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,800
Are you sure you'll be all right?

92
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,350
Leave it to me! I'm used to it!

93
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,620
Getting it ready was tough,

94
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,390
but it's kind of exciting,
like I'm visiting a hot spring.

95
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:05,970
Hot!

96
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,350
Sensei, is it too hot?!

97
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,200
No, it's fine.

98
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,370
Thank goodness...

99
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,120
Ahh, I've come back to life...

100
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,410
It's permeating right to the bone.

101
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,030
I can see why the village chief is into this.

102
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,960
It's like a reward for the effort.

103
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,340
Sensei, there's trouble!

104
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,090
What's wrong?!

105
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,260
Oops!

106
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,660
Naru!

107
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,960
Why are they here?!

108
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,480
They thought there was a fire.

109
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,470
A kid tendin' the fire while you have a nice bath?

110
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,120
As punishment, we'll see you naked!

111
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,190
I don't get your reasoning!

112
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,360
Weren't ya really wantin' young girls to see ya?

113
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,010
Don't talk like I'm an exhibitionist!

114
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,370
There's no fire here, so leave!

115
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,990
As always, he can't take a joke.

116
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,170
What's that camera for?

117
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,760
I thought I'd collect reference
material for my manga.

118
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,110
Reference material...

119
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,590
But ya can't show full nudity,
even in manga, right?

120
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,420
It'll be fine, if I add a mosaic over the tip.

121
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,470
So long as you can get the idea...

122
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,950
I can't relax.

123
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,600
No, it's still no good.

124
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,590
Looks like I can't take a bath during the day.

125
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,340
Eh? Why not?

126
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,340
At any rate, for now,

127
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,770
I'll wait until they get bored and leave.

128
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,000
It's too hot, idiots!

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,300
Run away!

130
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,690
Sensei, is it too hot?

131
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,030
Obviously!

132
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,070
See how red I am?

133
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,000
Run away!

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,030
No, don't you run away, too!

135
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,020
At any rate, that turned my mood around.

136
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,630
Okay, time to wri—

137
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,750
Hey.

138
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,650
Hiro!

139
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,690
Wh-What are you doing here?!

140
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,400
Mom's out today,

141
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
so I'm making you lunch.

142
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,280
Why at my house?

143
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,680
First, you cut the cucumber.

144
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,800
White Sugar

145
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,800
Combine miso...

146
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,050
White Sugar

147
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,050
and sugar, measuring by eye.

148
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,010
White Sugar

149
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,970
Now add the cucumber slices,

150
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,010
and mix loosely.

151
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,080
With these simple steps,

152
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,820
your miso cucumber is ready.

153
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,020
I feel like even I could make this.

154
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,400
First, cut the cucumber!

155
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,440
Combine miso and sugar, and mix!

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,870
Done!

157
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,920
Sensei, didn't you watch me?

158
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,150
What, aren't they the same?

159
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,200
In what way?!

160
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,890
It's all the same once you eat it.

161
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,710
It looks awful but tastes great.

162
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,290
That's what men's cooking is like!

163
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,490
Uh, no... this will definitely taste awful, too.

164
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,780
Let's eat.

165
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:27,800
Whoa!

166
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,880
This is great!

167
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,280
Sensei, yours is terrible.

168
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,510
All I can taste is cucumber.

169
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,240
Actually, this is awful, too.

170
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,330
Wait a minute!

171
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,140
You just said it was great!

172
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,030
I never said it was great.

173
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,350
All I can taste is miso.

174
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,860
Why're you so stubborn? That's immature.

175
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,760
Who are you calling immature?!

176
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,680
I'm older than you!

177
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,910
It's impolite to point!

178
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,680
If you're older, act your age and admit defeat!

179
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,110
Sensei!

180
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,360
What's wrong, Hina?!

181
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,830
Did something happen?

182
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,240
I can't understand your moaning! Settle down!

183
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,980
Don't rush her, Sensei.

184
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,170
Here, Hina. Drink this and calm down.

185
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,550
If she came over in such a rush, then it
must be an emergency! Tell us, quickly!

186
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,530
We don't need to rush so much
for a child's emergency.

187
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,940
But aren't you curious?!

188
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,760
You're being immature again.

189
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,210
All right, Hina! Just calm down!

190
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,540
We'll listen to you!

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,190
Naru...

192
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,240
Naru's getting picked on by grade
schoolers from the next village!

193
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,240
This way!

194
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,160
Naru! You all right?!

195
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,240
Cut it out!

196
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,230
Actually, that looks like a lot of fun.

197
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,500
Naru!

198
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,760
Hina! Save me!

199
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,640
You went and got grown-ups?!

200
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,380
Coward!

201
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,630
Where are you kids from?

202
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,900
This is their playground.

203
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,800
Shut up, fox-faced jerk!

204
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,600
We just took over this place!

205
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,380
Fox-faced jerk...

206
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,760
They're from Rokunosaki Village.

207
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,690
We haven't gotten along with the
neighboring village for ages.

208
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,550
Sensei, make 'em go away!

209
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,700
We were playin' here first!

210
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,220
Uh, sure.

211
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,610
Hey!

212
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,700
Kids from the next village!

213
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,260
How dare you call someone you've
just met a "fox-faced jerk"?

214
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,700
How am I a fox?

215
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,950
Sure, sometimes people say
I have a mean look in my eyes,

216
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,170
but only sometimes!

217
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,300
Sensei's making this totally personal...

218
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,250
Shut up, good-for-nothin' wimp!

219
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:33,960
Go away!

220
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,780
That hurt.

221
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,770
What is this?

222
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,150
My heart hurts.

223
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,400
That kid's amazing.

224
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,890
He only just met you, yet he can tell
that you're good-for-nothing and a wimp.

225
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,390
Hey!

226
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,230
With punks like these, tough talk won't work.

227
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,540
Hey, you guys!

228
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,470
Dyed blonde hair!

229
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,570
He's got dyed blonde hair!

230
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,230
What? You tryin' to threaten us?

231
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,370
Y'all are bigger'n these kids,

232
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,690
so can't ya be nice to 'em?

233
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,990
C'mon, can't ya?

234
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,810
If yer gonna say it that way...

235
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,000
Say it on yer knees.

236
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,830
Stop! Calm down, Hiro!

237
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,740
Let me go!

238
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,790
I'll show him how harsh society can be!

239
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,920
*Snot-nosed punk = Mean kid

240
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,920
Snot-nosed punk!

241
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,100
Run away!

242
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,560
Actually hitting a kid will
just cause more problems!

243
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,880
Stupid violent adult!

244
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,830
Yankee go home!

245
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,500
Sensei, we were wantin' to play dodgeball here.

246
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,500
Get out, outsider!

247
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,060
Well, then, we can't back down now.

248
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,650
These kids are counting on me.

249
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,020
Now is the time to show some dignity!

250
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,760
Hey, you boys!

251
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,270
You say somethin', white noodles?

252
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,780
White... noodles...?

253
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,860
We're adults, so we don't use violence.

254
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,900
However, if you guys throw your
weight around here any more,

255
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,200
I'll have to make a phone call.

256
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,080
What? Who're ya gonna call?

257
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,170
The police!

258
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,540
What makes ya think the police would come?!

259
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,380
I'll give an anonymous tip that
you guys are bullying little kids.

260
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,790
Getting arrested is embarrassing, y'know.

261
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,140
It'll upset your parents, too.

262
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,760
You'll be ruined for life.

263
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,050
You see?!

264
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,680
This is an adult tactic!

265
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,390
So immature.

266
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,050
Dang it, yer usin' dirty threats!

267
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,220
Take this!

268
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,450
You finished off my cell phone!

269
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,130
What do ya mean, "finished"?

270
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,870
It's just got poo on it.

271
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,160
Don't give me that, you brat!

272
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,480
Sure, it no longer works as a phone,

273
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,040
but it's still served me faithfully
as a clock! And look at it now!

274
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,380
Can't use it as a phone?

275
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,170
You were trickin' kids, then!

276
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,060
You insulted my phone,
so why are you getting mad?!

277
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,990
Hiro, were you laughing?

278
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,100
No, I'd never laugh at that.

279
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,150
Ah, what're they doin'?

280
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,760
Let's leave 'em and go play baseball.

281
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,350
Wha?!

282
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,200
Wait, Sensei!

283
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,310
They're trying to ignore us!

284
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,230
What?!

285
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,030
Don't make me repeat myself!

286
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,180
Use your own village's playground!

287
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,050
Shut up!

288
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,700
Middle schoolers took over our playground!

289
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,950
A real tough-fightin' girl and a glasses girl.

290
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,310
It's them...

291
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,750
That ain't got nothin' to do with it!

292
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,120
Get outta here!

293
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,450
Naru!

294
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,120
Hey! That's going too far!

295
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,190
What? Didn't ya say adults ain't violent?

296
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,070
If an adult from this village hits us,

297
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,860
we're tellin' our parents!

298
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,200
If an adult hits a kid,
that's who's goin' to the police!

299
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,390
You'll get arrested for child abuse!

300
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,720
If they put it that way, we can't argue.

301
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,730
Right, an adult should never strike a child.

302
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,360
Naru, they want to play baseball here.

303
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,980
So let them play.

304
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,010
Aww...

305
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,570
You shoulda done that in the first place!

306
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,200
They'll play their game.

307
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,940
So how about we play dodgeball?

308
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,950
Yeah.

309
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,580
You were gonna yield this place to us!

310
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,320
Play all the baseball you want.

311
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,460
We're going to play our own game.

312
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,870
Sensei and I will be outfielders.

313
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,540
Get running, you guys.

314
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,400
W-Wait, time out!

315
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,340
We're playin' here!

316
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,090
Here!

317
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:03,630
Ow!

318
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,320
That's our Sensei.

319
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,890
Playing seriously against kids.

320
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,120
It don't count if it don't hit us!

321
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,920
Clumsy—

322
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,020
Now, who's next?!

323
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,990
He hit it back?!

324
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,790
Get a grip, Sensei!

325
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,230
If they take the ball, it's all over.

326
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,430
Dang it, yer supposed to be adults!

327
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,650
Why are ya takin' this seriously?!

328
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,460
"Supposed to be adults"?

329
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,200
Hardly.

330
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,620
It's because we're adults!

331
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,200
Take this, brat!

332
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,790
Sensei, toss it here!

333
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,380
I'm impressed they can
horse around in this heat.

334
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,370
It's Akki!

335
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,260
Akki!

336
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,030
What're ya doin' out here?!

337
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,260
Hey, I'm stuck on that game ya lent me!

338
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,470
You guys! The battle's not over yet!

339
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,250
Oh, it's okay now.

340
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,970
We're gonna go play with Akki.

341
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,710
Wait a minute. You're giving up that easily?!

342
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,720
I'm sorry for interrupting your fun.

343
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,270
Uh, no, it wasn't really...

344
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,070
So long!

345
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,270
We'll come again!

346
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,710
Akki is amazingly mature.

347
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,500
Yeah...

348
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,450
Don't follow me.

349
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,340
I'm heading back to my house.

350
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,630
Aww! I wanna play more!

351
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,630
Don't stretch it!

352
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,130
By golly!

353
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,380
Let's play Tarzan! Tarzan!

354
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:24,880
Tarzan?

355
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,140
We play it up that way!

356
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,840
It's gobs of fun!

357
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,350
Oh, all right.

358
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,870
Just for a bit.

359
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,440
Yay! This way, this way!

360
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,150
Say...

361
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,400
This is...

362
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,660
the most realistic Tarzan setting I've ever seen.

363
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,230
It's easy!

364
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,360
No, it's not!

365
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,410
Isn't that a real vine?!

366
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,050
I'll show ya how it's done!

367
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,450
Stop, it's dangerous!

368
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,520
Hey!

369
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,380
Just... like that...

370
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,840
What'll I do?

371
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
This doesn't look fun at all.

372
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,750
Okay, it's yer turn next, Sensei!

373
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,790
As if I could!

374
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,540
Why not? It's real fun!

375
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,350
Yer pretty lame for a grown-up!

376
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,850
You wouldn't say that if you
had an adult's physique!

377
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,700
It's completely impossible!

378
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,270
There's no way this vine could
support an adult's weight.

379
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,350
Though, if all of you could hang from
it at once, it'd be a different story.

380
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,630
Oh, fine!

381
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,080
So I was wrong!

382
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,340
So, will ya do it too, Sensei?

383
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,570
All right, all right.

384
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,740
But I'm begging you, don't do
anything dangerous in front of me!

385
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,590
All right! This'll be gobs of fun!

386
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,810
You may be trying to convince me of that,

387
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,540
but I'm not happy about it.

388
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,430
As long as this vine is here,
they're going to get hurt someday.

389
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,770
Sorry, kids, but I'm getting rid
of this dangerous toy.

390
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,130
Yer rarin' to go!

391
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,550
I'll pretend to swing, and tear it off!

392
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,040
No, Sensei, you can't stretch it like that!

393
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,560
Stop it!

394
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,000
It'll tear!

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,480
Don't!

396
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,020
Everybody, stop!

397
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,000
Are any of you guys hurt?

398
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,050
Nope, we're fine!

399
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,880
That was super scary!

400
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,660
I thought I was gonna die!
I thought I was gonna die!

401
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,840
I thought I was gonna die!
I thought I was gonna die!

402
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,030
Sensei, yer bleedin'!

403
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,240
You all right?!

404
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,070
I'm fine.

405
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,160
It's just a scratch.

406
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,680
Ya need mugwort for that!

407
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,680
Get lookin' for mugwort!

408
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,040
No, that's okay!

409
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,000
It's not that bad!

410
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,580
Naru!

411
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,520
I got mugwort!

412
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,550
This medicine'll stop the bleedin'!

413
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,080
I said it's just a scratch!

414
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,940
That'll only get bacteria in it!

415
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,290
This's a shortcut home!

416
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,490
Yet another unproductive day...

417
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,700
Day after day I play with kids,

418
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,650
but don't get anything out of it.

419
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,330
Is it really okay to just wait
for inspiration to strike?

420
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,310
The deadline keeps drawing closer...

421
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,170
Closer...

422
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,380
There!

423
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,370
That's it!

424
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,970
The God of Calligraphy has descended!

425
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,940
I never thought I'd find the
desire to write this easily!

426
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,040
I have to rush home and write!

427
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,520
Right now, I can do it!

428
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,650
What's the matter, Naru?

429
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,920
Sensei's not followin' us.

430
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,280
He just went home a different
way without tellin' us.

431
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,660
Ya may be right.

432
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,710
I am right!

433
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,470
Sensei's always like that.

434
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,250
Yer right!

435
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,220
Darn right!

436
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,250
Sensei ain't home yet?!

437
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,290
There wasn't anyone here when we came.

438
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,230
On our way back from the mountain,

439
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,720
Sensei just disappeared.

440
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,640
Disappeared?

441
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,390
I know what happened!

442
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,270
I Want to
Be a Hermit

443
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,460
A wild giant from the hills must've
trapped him and gobbled him up!

444
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,010
Monster or not, it's still worrisome
that he hasn't returned yet.

445
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,900
Even if he got lost in the hills,
the forest ain't that deep.

446
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,190
There!

447
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:23,950
Just a rabbit?

448
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,160
That scared me!

449
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,640
And I finally felt like I could
write good calligraphy...

450
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,250
The time I just spent playing
with the kids feels far in the past.

451
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,380
This is bad!

452
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,080
I'm panicking so much that my brain's
started to fabricate memories!

453
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,600
Keep calm, keep calm.

454
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,800
A little further up, and I'll be back on the path.

455
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,630
You can do it, Seishuu!

456
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,880
You can do it, Seishuu!

457
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,300
All right!

458
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:02,950
Ow!

459
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,410
This can't be happening...

460
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,210
C'mon, cut it out already!

461
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,470
Darn it!

462
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:16,960
Pose to reduce surface area
in contact with ground

463
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,400
Isn't it about time someone came to rescue me?!

464
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,910
What are they doing?

465
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,860
Getting lost in the wilderness

466
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,960
is the height of isolation!

467
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,710
I'm going to die.

468
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,680
I'm going to end up dying alone, literally.

469
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,330
Somebody save me!

470
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,340
I don't care who!

471
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,420
What's that?

472
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,680
What, it's just a key?

473
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,160
It's a key to my house!

474
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,160
The duplicate key?

475
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,250
I lost it.

476
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,410
Maybe while playin' in the hills out back?

477
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,790
That girl...

478
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,050
This is ridiculous!

479
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,730
What am I freaking out about?
I'm in the hills behind my house!

480
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,710
Who the heck gets hopelessly
lost in his own backyard?

481
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,600
What's this?

482
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,430
Amazing...

483
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,410
Is this outer space?

484
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,290
A shooting star!

485
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,850
Please fix my bath. Please fix my bath.

486
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,360
Please fix my bath!

487
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,020
No, that's not it.

488
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,990
Please let me get home soon
and write calligraphy!

489
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,750
See? I told ya he fell off the edge.

490
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,320
No wonder he wasn't on the
usual paths when we looked.

491
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,990
Sensei, I'm so glad yer safe!

492
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,620
Sheesh!

493
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,110
What took you so long?

494
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,300
Is Sensei cryin'?

495
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,550
Yes, he is...

496
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,970
Yes! It's finally come!

497
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,950
Sensei!

498
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,310
I brought the first aid...

499
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,980
Here! It's here!

500
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,920
He's in the middle of work.

501
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,440
Seishuu
Handa

502
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,320
Seishuu
Handa

503
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,070
