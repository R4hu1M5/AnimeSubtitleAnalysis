1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,940
We're goin' fishin'!

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,860
I'm not happy with this, Handa-kun.

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,890
With what?

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,510
I took off five whole days to come to this island,

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,640
but all I've gotten to do is look for your house,

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,270
then suffer a hangover after a bunch
of strange old guys got me drunk.

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,840
I want my vacation back.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,000
You brought it on yourself.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,010
We're fishin' 'cuz you said you wanted
to make the most of yer last day here.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,300
Listen, middle schooler...

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,070
By "make the most of,"

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,470
I meant going sightseeing. Get it?

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,260
What sights?

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,010
Dunno any sightseein' spots here.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,840
I'm not happy, either!

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,280
This was my big chance to see you
write calligraphy at close proximity!

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,080
I can't believe we're outdoors!

18
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,360
Are even his vacation goals indoors?

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,700
What's wrong, Hiro?

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,600
You don't look well.

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,790
I had to listen to his theories
on calligraphy all night.

22
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,350
I started doing the art back in grade school!

23
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,350
There was this U-23 exhibition...

24
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,350
I'm very particular about my brush!

25
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,750
I didn't get a wink of sleep.

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,860
I wanna stay indoors!

27
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,340
Bamboo Pole

28
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,760
Fish Hooks with
Artificial Lure

29
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,380
Here's your tackle.

30
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,650
What do we catch with this?

31
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,420
Bait
Basket

32
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,390
Horse mackerel.

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,430
You don't just put bait on a hook?

34
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,890
I've never seen these before!

35
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,520
Wait, is this yer first time fishin'?!

36
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,020
It's a bamboo stalk!

37
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,020
Yeah.

38
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,720
And you, Kawa-san?

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,810
Don't lump me in with those city boys.

40
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,820
I go for bass!

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,430
Uh, that won't help catchin' horse mackerel.

42
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,180
Bigger covers smaller.

43
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,990
But ocean ain't river.

44
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,410
Get it off me!

45
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,830
Naru.

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,310
Put bait in this.

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,960
I can't touch it.

48
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,540
Ayup!

49
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,690
Huh?

50
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,070
There's bait on the hooks, too...

51
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,170
Eww...

52
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,170
It's fake?

53
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,380
Come on, grab it!

54
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,380
The pole smells fishy!

55
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,520
I can't take this!

56
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,670
It's too high! Let it down!

57
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,380
Quit your bellyachin'!

58
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,300
Speak proper Japanese!

59
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,720
I didn't come to teach city folk fishin'.

60
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,760
Aw, shaddup!

61
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,360
I'm goin' up above, so good luck, Miwa.

62
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,560
Yer runnin' away, Hiro-nii?!

63
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,690
I'm a man of the sea.

64
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,290
I'm beyond horse mackerel.

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,570
I go for...

66
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,860
hisan-iwo.

67
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,110
Hisan-iwo!

68
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,200
Hisan-iwo?

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,280
Hisan-iwo!

70
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,240
Hisan-iwo!

71
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:21,950
Hisan-iwo!

72
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,220
Hisan-iwo! Hisan-iwo!

73
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,220
Yer amazin', Hiro-nii.

74
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,290
Good luck! I hope ya catch one!

75
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,610
What's "hisan-iwo"?

76
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,620
Beats me.

77
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,890
Maybe a "hideous-sad" fish?

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,710
Barakamon

79
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,980
Hisan-Iwo

80
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,980
Translation:
A High-Grade Fish

81
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,170
First, toss in ground bait.

82
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,930
Thanks.

83
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,360
Then, drop the line where you threw the bait.

84
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,490
When the end of the pole wiggles...

85
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,910
Do like this.

86
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,060
Wow!

87
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,410
Gramma said it'd be good fishin' today.

88
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,360
Great, I'll fish!

89
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,960
Me, too.

90
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,420
We'll have fried horse mackerel for dinner!

91
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,310
It feels like I got one!

92
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,130
Pull it up!

93
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,690
I caught two whole fish.

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
A big catch!

95
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,930
Naru.

96
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,930
Ayup!

97
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,640
Yer roles are reversed...

98
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,070
Check it out, Handa. I got three!

99
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,400
What? I won't lose!

100
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,040
I got a bite, too!

101
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,490
It's strong! What a pull!

102
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,090
It's definitely a big one!

103
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:08,070
Ahahahahahahahaha!

104
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,380
I'm a genius at fishing as well as calligraphy!

105
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,070
Behold, ignoramuses!
See our difference in status!

106
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,060
It's stuck in the shoal.

107
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,700
Shoal?

108
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,550
Reelin' in the Earth, huh? Yer real good!

109
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,940
Look, wharf roaches!

110
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,510
It can't be...

111
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,220
Gobs of 'em!

112
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,560
Naru has obtained Slightly Longish Stick!

113
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,300
Gotcha!

114
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,440
Hina, hold out yer hand.

115
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,350
No!

116
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,430
It'll be fine.

117
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,030
No!

118
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,050
It'll be fine!

119
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,530
No! They bite!

120
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,990
I'm sick of this!

121
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,130
I stink, I can't fish, I'm hot... I wanna go home!

122
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,170
But I just landed that huge catch.
We can't leave yet.

123
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,880
I want to write calligraphy with you, Sensei!

124
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,880
W-Wait... Hey!

125
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,990
You hate outdoor activities too, don't you?

126
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,340
Let's go back to your house!

127
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,870
I don't want to

128
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,500
write calligraphy with you.

129
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,720
Why would you say that?!

130
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,310
You'll just say I've gotten worse again.

131
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,680
Kousuke!

132
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,560
Did you really tell him that?!

133
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,770
Well...

134
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,980
It's the truth.

135
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,710
Can't you see anything from any
viewpoint besides your own?!

136
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,490
This is why you're in a slump!

137
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,080
A slump? You can't write?

138
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,000
It's because he was looking
at your earlier calligraphy.

139
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,520
You haven't gotten worse, Handa.

140
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,190
If you had, you wouldn't have
placed at all, much less second.

141
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,010
Kousuke was focused on your earlier work.

142
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,290
So, after your style changed,

143
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,010
he got anxious about losing his model.

144
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,220
Just look at them.

145
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,560
That's what I'm saying.

146
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,890
What's this about?

147
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,940
Children imitate their superiors, right?

148
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,940
Handa, have you seen Kousuke's calligraphy?

149
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,990
No, I don't look at that stuff.

150
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,780
I figured.

151
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,030
His calligraphy looks just like yours.

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,220
And your calligraphy is just like your dad's.

153
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,090
You're both only faithful to the fundamentals.

154
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,490
But I got first place with that,
so aren't the fundamentals best?

155
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,000
Was that a subtle dig at my father?

156
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,700
The role of the young

157
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,510
is to break new ground without fear of failure!

158
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,140
The director!

159
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,630
Remain in memories, not record books!

160
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,740
Lose the battle, win the war!

161
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,900
Only One is better than Number One!

162
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,980
Good-selling beats prize-winning!

163
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,950
That one's your wish!

164
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,130
Bring me money...

165
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,410
He's being consumed!

166
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,650
Sensei!

167
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,130
I learned from Miwa-nee.

168
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:52,950
Use this.

169
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,060
Wow, did you tie that, Hina?

170
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,590
Sensei, use mine, too.

171
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,580
You made one, too?

172
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,450
Mine is super-ultra.

173
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,870
It'll catch gobs!

174
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,630
You can't catch anything with that!

175
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,610
Is this "breaking new ground"?

176
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,820
Well, yeah, pretty much...

177
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,420
That's the incarnation of failure!

178
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,070
Hey, don't laugh so much.

179
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,360
A child made it.

180
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,560
But, it's just so simple-minded!

181
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,060
Tackle!

182
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,190
You... brat!

183
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,870
I'll let you off for today.

184
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,620
They're having fun down there...

185
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,270
Hiro-nii, ya got ground bait?

186
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:43,990
Huh?

187
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,290
Yer already out?

188
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,500
Hina tossed it all.

189
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,090
Were they able to fish right?

190
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,880
Found my glasses!

191
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,760
In the end, they've just been
talkin' calligraphy here, too.

192
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,020
All this about bein' bad or not.

193
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,970
Ain't it enough for someone
good at it to be good?

194
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,470
I guess when ya reach the top,
there ain't nowhere left to go.

195
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,830
Maybe I won't catch hisan-iwo today, either.

196
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,980
Guess it's really impossible 'round here.

197
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,240
But the village chief was sayin'
he saw someone catch one here.

198
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,380
Hey, Hiroshi! Caught any hisan-iwo yet?

199
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,630
Not a one.

200
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,950
Wanna call it a day?

201
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,530
Hiroshi, try usin' this.

202
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,580
What's that? It looks like cursed tackle.

203
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,290
Uh, sorry.

204
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,420
All right, it's my last cast,
so I'll give it a try.

205
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,810
Make sure ya say "Ebisu."

206
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,050
I know, I know.

207
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,290
What are they talking about?

208
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,340
A magic spell.

209
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,930
They say, if ya say "Ebisu" while castin'
yer line, you'll catch a hisan-iwo.

210
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,200
Ebisu, as in one of the Seven Lucky Gods?

211
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,940
'Cuz Ebisu's holdin' a hisan-iwo.

212
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,810
Hisan-iwo is snapper?!

213
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,230
Rock snapper, to be precise.

214
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,030
But they fish for snapper in open sea.

215
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,100
If you could catch them at places like this,
then anyone could be a fisherman.

216
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,070
Don't knock it.

217
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,580
But, if he catches one, we'll
have snapper sashimi for dinner.

218
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,830
Ebisu!

219
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,290
Now they're motivated?

220
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,230
Of course!

221
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,960
How can we leave this island
without eating anything tasty?

222
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,390
Nothing's biting.

223
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,520
Yeah.

224
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,270
You guys forgot that you're trying
to fish with that hook, didn't you?

225
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,100
All right, let's pack up.

226
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,720
Aww!

227
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,310
I'm going to clean up, so hold onto it.

228
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,620
Me?!

229
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,170
You haven't caught anything yet, right?

230
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,150
W-Wait!

231
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,400
Aw, ...

232
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,170
Huh?!

233
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,510
I got a bite!

234
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,780
What?

235
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,870
Miwa, the net!

236
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,640
I'm on it!

237
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,810
Is it thanks to Ebisu?

238
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,010
All right, let's help, too!

239
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,250
Hey, you're in the way!

240
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,970
Dummy, you can't land such
a big one by yourself.

241
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,030
I can, too!

242
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,100
You just want to steal my thunder, don't you?!

243
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,900
Ebisu! Ebisu!

244
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,980
Quit yelling!

245
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,900
All right!

246
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,610
We got it!

247
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,950
It's huge!

248
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,970
That sure was a big one!

249
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,160
Yeah, no kiddin'!

250
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,640
And that "plop."

251
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,310
The "big one" went "plop"!

252
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,400
My belly hurts.

253
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,620
The hook broke up in midair!

254
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,550
Let's go.

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,070
Well, we caught a bunch of
horse mackerel, so that's fine.

256
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,200
We'll fry them at my place.

257
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,300
They're good pickled, too.

258
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's go, Sensei.

259
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,970
For some reason...

260
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:25,050
Since I came to this island, there are times
when I really want to write calligraphy.

261
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,600
I feel something well up,

262
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,140
and my hands tremble.

263
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,840
Right now,

264
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,200
I feel the same way.

265
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,790
These are the ones Sensei caught.

266
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,190
So...

267
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,750
Today, to celebrate our visit to this island...

268
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,460
Good work, everyone!

269
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,340
Don't ignore me!

270
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,660
Let's dig in!

271
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,510
These fish have ink on them...

272
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,050
That's wreckage from breaking new ground.

273
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,020
I would rather eat snapper, but oh well.

274
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,800
You guys work hard and grow,

275
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,690
and make me wealthy.

276
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,810
You always did have that side to you.

277
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,900
To Kawafuji-san, I'm just a commodity.

278
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,900
Do you know what he meant
by "breakin' new ground"?

279
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,840
Beats me.

280
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,400
Look in the room.

281
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,670
Peeking without asking again...

282
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,290
Me next.

283
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,130
Pretty good!

284
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,530
I always did like yer calligraphy, Sensei,

285
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,800
but this one's the best!

286
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:53,060
SNAPPER

287
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,560
Fukue Airport

288
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:02,390
Flight 635 to Fukuoka will begin boarding at 10:20.

289
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,930
Sheesh.

290
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,420
You didn't need to come see us off.

291
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,840
Passengers, please proceed to the boarding gate.

292
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,280
It's only about three hours to Tokyo.

293
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,480
Well, I can understand the reluctance to part,

294
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,360
What's this?

295
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,670
Kankoro mochi.

296
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,540
but you didn't need to make this much fuss...

297
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,350
It tastes great if ya heat it in a toaster oven.

298
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,270
Look, Kawafuji!

299
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,560
It's written "Happiki Kaminari"
(Eight Lightning Beasts),

300
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,550
but pronounced "Hacchi-Kankan."

301
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,080
These TV rocks are a rock revolution!

302
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,600
What did you really come here for?

303
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,250
Oh, what's that?

304
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,620
Why are the locals here so hyper?

305
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,830
There's time before your departure,

306
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,590
so you should buy some souvenirs, Kawafuji-kun.

307
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,470
Yeah...

308
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,690
I appreciate all you did for me.

309
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,680
Don't mention it.

310
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,270
Sensei's friends are very welcome here.

311
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,830
The village children normally
only interact with local people,

312
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,280
so they enjoyed playing
with people from the city.

313
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,590
Look, ain't this amazin'?

314
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,150
There's somethin' over here!

315
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,940
There's a bunch of toys.

316
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,290
The airport's amazin'!

317
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,170
It's like Santa Claus's house.

318
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,790
Wanna take one with you?

319
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,790
Nah, I'll pass.

320
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,250
Say, which product is this island known for?

321
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,690
Well, let's see...

322
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,320
Kankoro mochi,

323
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,680
Camellia candy,

324
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,010
oval squid, sea urchin,

325
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,130
Gotou udon,

326
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,300
Gotou beef...

327
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,560
I can't take that much home.

328
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,010
Is there anything besides food?

329
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,820
How about a cell phone strap?

330
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,980
They're pretty standard.

331
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,440
Gotou Exclusive

332
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,440
Baramon-kun

333
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,050
That's totally not cute!

334
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,440
Take back a bunch of Baramon-kun
for your friends in Tokyo.

335
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't have any friends,
so I'll just buy one for me.

336
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,650
I'm...

337
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,050
sorry.

338
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,700
For what?

339
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,010
I'll buy one, too.

340
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm gonna buy this!

341
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,530
Buy it?

342
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,230
Don't you mean, make me buy it?

343
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,340
I'm beggin' you, Sensei!

344
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,560
It's my dyin' request...

345
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,300
Don't invoke the next world at your age.

346
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,680
But I really wanna give this to Kawafuji!

347
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,640
Honestly, you...

348
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,140
sure know what he really likes!

349
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,600
I don't like those!

350
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,410
You bought a lot of souvenirs.

351
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,860
I bragged to my coworkers about coming
to Gotou, so I had to keep up appearances.

352
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:18,860
Flight 635 to Fukuoka will now begin boarding.

353
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,620
It's time.

354
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,800
Sorry I couldn't provide you any hospitality at all.

355
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,390
Please board at gate number one.

356
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,910
I already know you're insensitive.

357
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,600
Well, I was just glad to see you doing well.

358
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,170
I can give a good report to Handa-sensei.

359
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,670
You see my dad?

360
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,430
Occasionally, in connection with work.

361
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,930
Although he sent you away, he was still worried.

362
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,430
I see...

363
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,270
What's wrong?

364
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,630
Why so surprised?

365
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,890
It's just... knowing you,

366
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,530
I thought you'd keep playing the rebel
and say something like, "As if he'd worry."

367
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,860
Lately I've been thinking,

368
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,000
maybe Dad doesn't hate me after all.

369
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,990
You're only just realizing that now?

370
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,630
Strict isn't the same as hateful.

371
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,800
From the outside, I'd say he's pretty doting.

372
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,760
What?! He is not!

373
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,220
Call once in a while.

374
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,890
Kawafuji...

375
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,430
Has Kawa-san started boarding already?!

376
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,390
No, not yet.

377
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,620
But soon.

378
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,640
His glasses!

379
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,950
His glasses got him!

380
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,520
I knew he'd get caught.

381
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,740
That's why you wanted to...

382
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,190
Not my glasses, my belt!

383
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,550
Too funny!

384
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,850
He's sayin' something.

385
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,890
Was he hiding a knife in those glasses?

386
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,750
Kawafuji, I'm embarrassed as your friend.

387
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,070
Sensei.

388
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,960
Thank you very much.

389
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,510
Although I did all those rude things,

390
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,260
I'm truly happy to have met you.

391
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,950
It was very educational.

392
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,610
Educational?

393
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,390
This isn't a school trip.

394
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,430
If we continue on the same path,

395
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,650
we're likely to meet again.

396
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,210
I'm also happy to have met you.

397
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,720
Instead of being jealous
of some guy I don't know,

398
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,410
I feel better after meeting you face to face.

399
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,580
Come visit again.

400
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,720
Yes! I will definitely come again!

401
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,290
Definitely!

402
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,250
I'm dying! Are they trying to kill me?

403
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,980
The metal detector's capture
ability is tremendous!

404
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,430
I'm kinda embarrassed, myself...

405
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,320
Oh, no!

406
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,320
I forgot to give 'em the souvenir
Grampa sent with me!

407
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,520
There's still time!

408
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,350
Go, Naru!

409
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:00,990
Ayup!

410
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,140
Wait...

411
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,160
She shouldn't have anything metal on her.

412
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,420
There they come.

413
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,300
Kawa-san sees us.

414
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,050
He's wavin'.

415
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,060
It'll be lonely without 'em.

416
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,560
And we only just met them.

417
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,470
Sensei's even more...

418
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,430
No fair! You got a drink!

419
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,040
Gimme!

420
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,790
You jealous?

421
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,980
His adaptability's the real deal.

422
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,980
Gimme!

423
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,110
Tokyo, huh...

424
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,960
Somethin' wrong?

425
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,070
You wanna go to Tokyo too, Hiro-nii?

426
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,250
Not so much that I wanna go to Tokyo...

427
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,090
But I was thinkin', the day'll come
when we'll be leavin' the island, too.

428
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,180
I'm in my last year of high school,

429
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,880
so I oughta consider that reality.

430
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,950
Hey, I was having a serious scene!

431
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,430
They're flyin'!

432
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,690
Bye-bye!

433
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,730
Bye-bye!

434
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,740
Bye-bye!

435
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,250
Bye-bye!

436
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,680
We'd be over capacity.

437
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,230
Kawafuji-kun returned his rental car,

438
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,900
so take the bus home.

439
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,630
Bye-bye!

440
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,930
Hey!

441
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,930
Wait!

442
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,470
There's room for us in there!

443
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,470
Hold it!

444
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,930
Bet you'll be lonely with your friends gone.

445
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,220
No...

446
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,450
I can look forward to seeing them again.

447
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,260
What was the souvenir from Naru?

448
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,120
So that's what set it off.

449
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,910
Naru

450
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,900
Let's come again.

451
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,530
Yes.

452
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,530
Hey...

453
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,860
Next time...

454
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,340
I'll come alone.
