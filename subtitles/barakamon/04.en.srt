1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,730
It's no good if yer always lookin' up.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,550
Wait patiently...

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,360
And take it once it hits the ground.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,740
It's no good to always be looking up.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,520
Move patiently... at my own pace.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,590
If I practice calligraphy steadily,
without cutting corners on my work,

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,540
then, in time, I may find my own style.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,920
Still...

Movie: Demon Aher 2

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,380
What kind of movie is this?

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,720
Te~pid Tea

It was popular enough to get a sequel?

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,650
Okay.

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,110
Huh?

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,660
It's broken!

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,300
What'll I do now?!

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,730
I doubt this island has a place
that will fix computers.

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,120
Oh! Kawafuji!

20
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,520
!

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,660
It hasn't worked right since
I dropped it in the ocean...

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,640
It's finally busted completely?

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,930
No computer, no cell phone, no landline...

24
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,440
How can I contact anyone
from a place like this?!

Island Dads

28
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,110
A whole month has passed
since I came to this island.

29
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,470
Contrary to the slow life I expected,
my days are unexpectedly busy.

30
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,360
Amidst all that,

31
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,220
there is one place that always heals my heart.

32
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,810
There you are!

33
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,590
Yes...

34
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,470
This place is a paradise for cat lovers.

35
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,320
So cute...

36
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,490
I want to pet them...

37
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,620
But this is someone else's property.

38
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,700
C'mon, come closer!

39
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,920
Shoo! Shoo! You filchin' felines!

40
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,280
things broke into the fridge again!

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,010
Landsakes, no need to get so mad.

42
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,800
Anyone'd be mad, if their
sashimi dinner got eaten up!

43
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,700
Oh, Sensei, you need somethin'?

44
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,810
Ah, so you like cats, too.

45
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,030
Well, come see 'em anytime you like.

46
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,600
What?! Can I really?

47
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,330
They're all strays that settled
here before I realized.

48
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,580
Th-Then, I won't hold back.

49
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,530
Here, kitties!

50
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,270
I told ya, they're strays.
They don't come near people.

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,210
Please say so sooner.

52
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,500
What am I supposed to do with my arms now?

53
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,740
We could tempt 'em with this.

54
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,690
Stew left over from lunch.

55
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,550
C'mere, Whitey!

56
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,320
Wow, a bunch came over!

57
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,990
With the sashimi gone,

58
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,970
those "leftovers from lunch"
should be my dinner...

59
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,020
Wow, a bunch came over!

60
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,290
So you named one "Whitey"?

61
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,620
I just call 'em that when I call 'em.

62
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,790
They're just strays.

63
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,990
Society would consider these pet cats, though.

64
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,270
What about that tabby cat?

65
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,120
C'mere, Blackie!

66
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,780
Not "Tabby"?

67
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,020
Blackie's the one that's closest to people.

68
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,250
The other strays won't let you pet 'em,

69
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,320
but Blackie's a smart cookie.

70
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,960
*Smart Cookie = Good Kitty

71
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,630
Wanna hold one, Sensei?

72
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,820
Can I really?

73
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,880
I do! Please let me hold one!

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,610
All right...

75
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,520
Hurry up an' take it! I can't hold it long!

76
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,270
I don't know how!

77
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,230
Make a bold grab!

78
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,520
Then hold on tight with both hands!

79
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,360
All right!

80
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,700
I got it!

81
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,710
Nothing to it.

82
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,530
Even a stray kitten is still cute.

83
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,370
I told ya to hold on tight!

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,560
Say, are you all right?

85
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,450
Sensei, you got a rash on yer neck!

86
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,820
What is this?

87
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,740
It itches!

88
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,920
My eyes itch, too!

89
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,600
Sensei, think ya might be allergic to cats?

90
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,100
Allergic to cats?

91
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,920
Oh, a cat!

92
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,170
Don't, Sei.

93
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,060
You shouldn't approach animals carelessly.

94
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,070
You don't want to be itchy, do you?

95
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,430
If that happens, I can't take the itching from you.

96
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,950
So I can never have a cat...

97
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,410
I never would've known if I hadn't touched one.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,460
Excuse me!

99
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,380
Shopkeeper, the phone—

100
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,670
It's Sensei!

101
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,030
What'd you come for?

102
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,210
For shoppin'?

103
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,180
You kids are everywhere...

104
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,310
Oh, Sensei, you got a rash on your neck.

105
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,140
Don't remind me...

106
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,840
Where's the shopkeeper?

107
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,730
She went to the senior center.

108
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,060
You may shop if you like.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,020
No, I just need to borrow the phone.

110
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,850
Sensei, d'ya know Akki?

111
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,820
Akki?

112
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,730
Yeah, Akki!

113
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,530
I am Akki.

114
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,630
Akki's amazin'!

115
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,050
He's real good at video games!

116
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,170
He's like Master Takahashi!

117
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,000
Who's Takahashi?

118
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,420
Play For Just One Hour Each Day

119
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,370
Ya don't know Master Takahashi?

120
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,420
Huh?! Is he really that famous?!

121
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,420
16 Hits

122
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,870
Is he a kyogen performer or something?

123
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,870
He's a master at video games.

124
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,180
You need the telephone, right?

125
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,140
Yeah.

126
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,100
Akki, huh...

127
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,100
I feel like I've seen him somewhere before...

128
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,640
Are you Tama's younger brother?!

129
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,360
Well... yes, I am...

130
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,420
Wow, you look so much like her!

131
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,410
Are you a clone?!

132
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,320
Please stop. We don't look alike.

133
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,600
No, you do!

134
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,470
Genetics are amazing!

135
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,450
Please, just hurry up and use the phone!

136
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,280
It bothers you that much?

137
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,280
Here!

138
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,350
Woah, it's black!

139
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,830
Yes, because it's a black telephone.

140
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,890
What is this thing?

141
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,770
I've only seen these on television.

142
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,710
In an era of cell phones with cameras and
touch-sensitive screens, why is this here?

143
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,340
I scared ya!

144
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,100
I'll be playing a game,
so help yourself to the phone.

145
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,500
Uh, sure.

146
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm about to make an important
phone call, so be quiet.

147
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,940
Let's see...

148
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,630
Zero...

149
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,990
What the heck?

150
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,040
Nothing happens when I press it.

151
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,450
Is this thing broken?

152
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,910
Um...

153
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,690
You don't press on it.

154
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,660
You turn it.

155
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,620
I knew that!

156
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,910
This black phone is just
stiff and hard to turn!

157
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,580
He blamed the phone...

158
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,040
Like this, right?

159
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,050
See? I turned it!

160
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,460
Indeed, you did.

161
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,010
You can take yer finger out now.

162
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,890
I knew that!

163
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,070
It won't work unless you pick
up the receiver before dialing.

164
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,390
Just tell me the number you want to call.

165
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,070
I'll dial it for you.

166
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,470
If you pity me, give me money!

167
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,020
Yes, hello...

168
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,490
Be quiet, I'm on the phone!

169
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, Kawafuji?

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,970
Sounds lively on your end.

171
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,060
What do you need?

172
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,570
My computer broke, so I need to get a new one.

173
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,390
I can't get work without it.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,070
About that, Handa.

175
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,080
I'd like you to take a break
from work for a while.

176
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,740
Huh? What do you mean?

177
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,640
Autumn's the deadline for the
Naruka Institute Exhibition.

178
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,420
This is no time for you to be working.

179
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,800
As your friend, I thought I should look out for you.

180
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,040
What's the date?

181
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,060
September 10th.

182
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,070
41st Naruka Institute Calligraphy Exhibition

183
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,070
Naruka
Sept. 10
Handa &
Kanzaki

184
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,070
Well, we can let it go this time
if you don't feel up to it,

185
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,190
but if you consider...

186
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,360
Order the writing equipment
I'm about to describe.

187
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,780
Can I expect you to get the grand prize this time?

188
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,330
I'm not sure.

189
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,620
Right now I'm in total darkness,

190
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,560
but I'll definitely find the light, someday.

191
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,570
Definitely.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,600
So, what's the cost per minute?

193
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,010
"Right now I'm in total darkness..."

194
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,220
"But I'll definitely find the light."

195
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,640
Was what I said that bad?

196
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,580
In eighth grade, you claimed to harbor
some power in your left arm, didn't you?

197
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,070
That's beside the point!

198
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,910
I talked for about five minutes,
so will fifty yen be enough?

199
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,370
The phone costs ten yen per call.

200
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,580
Is that really enough?

201
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,630
Gramma says to use it for free,

202
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,740
but everyone leaves ten yen.

203
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,050
Okay, here's ten yen.

204
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,670
And this comes to forty yen.

205
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,860
Naru!

206
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,760
Yay!

207
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,930
And Hina!

208
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,990
Sorry about that.

209
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,450
Here, you too, Akki.

210
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,180
Thank you very much.

211
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,110
Look!

212
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,140
I made a nice, fat balloon!

213
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,900
Hey! Don't touch it with your dirty hand!

214
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,520
Hina!

215
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,350
What the heck did you do?!

216
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,080
I'd assumed that a calligrapher
would be more stuffy.

217
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,560
I never would've known the
truth if I hadn't met you.

218
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,830
You're an odd person, like they say.

219
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,020
Odd?

220
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,710
Can I come to visit sometime?

221
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,880
You mean I'll have both siblings
coming to trash my house?

222
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,820
C'mon over!

223
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,980
Don't answer for me!

224
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,180
...

225
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,730
None of this is good enough!

226
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,850
Can't write anything...

227
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,040
Maybe it's because I stopped working
to focus on the exhibition.

228
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,200
Writing even a single sheet
feels like a huge undertaking.

229
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,200
If I can't improve my mood and
write something, the deadline—

230
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,640
Hey! What're you tryin' to do?!

231
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,200
Ya spilled all the seaweed
I worked hard to collect!

232
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,330
Sorry! I was lost in thought...

233
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,100
Lost in thought?

234
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,630
Ya expect to get off the hook
with an excuse like that?

235
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,380
Ya think that's enough?!

236
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,840
He's a gangster!

237
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,600
Ain't seen your face before...

238
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,100
I moved in recently—

239
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,800
Yer the penmanship teacher?!

240
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,610
Y-Yes, I am.

241
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,990
I heard yer an odd person, but a bad apple?!

242
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,650
Odd again...

243
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,430
Yer gonna do me a little favor, Sensei...

244
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,960
Hey, wait! Where are we going?!

245
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,460
Don't worry about it!

246
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,370
Oh, forgot my bike.

247
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,500
Caught by a Grade-A annoying old guy!

248
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,590
Okay, Sensei!

249
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,620
Do yer thing.

250
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,170
Write on it, real flashy!

251
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,870
Yer outta luck, gettin' caught up with my dad.

252
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,270
After I told him 'bout you,

253
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,060
he exclaimed, "I'll have
him write my boat's name!"

254
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,000
He's your dad?

255
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,390
I give up on everything.

256
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,860
I can't wait...

257
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,690
He looks like he'd never forgive any failure.

258
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,280
Dad is mighty scary when he's mad.

259
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,850
Will the boat's name be
"Miwa-maru," as the custom goes?

260
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,830
Dad's a liquor seller.
He just bought the boat for fun.

261
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,620
I ain't gonna give it my name.

262
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,330
Small Craft Registration Form

263
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,330
Boat Name: Yuigadokuson-Maru
(I Alone Am Holy)

264
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,330
Owner: Yamamura Iwao

265
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,010
Very unique taste...

266
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm so glad Mom picked my name.

267
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,980
What's "Yuigadokuson" mean?

268
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,840
It means that I'm God, of course!

269
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,930
I'm so embarrassed...

270
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,930
They're definitely related...

271
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,390
Five kanji characters...

272
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,500
That's a lot.

273
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,060
And with the curves of the hull,
it'll be hard to keep them balanced.

274
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,560
These aren't my usual tools, either.

275
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,830
Even discounting the pressure
he's putting on me,

276
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,870
I definitely can't afford to mess this up!

277
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,570
It's paint!

278
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,020
Ta-da!

279
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,380
Bam!

280
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,560
The paint's gonna melt yer hands.

281
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,170
Wash it off!

282
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,280
I need to make a draft,

283
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,250
so I'll go write it at home and come back.

284
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:27,920
Wha?!

285
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:35,430
Yuigadokuson-Maru

286
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,550
First, I'll cut out the letters that I wrote,

287
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,970
then I'll paint over the stencil...

288
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,430
Now hold on, Sensei!

289
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,310
That's like all those other cookie-cutter boats!

290
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,690
I want my boat to be one-of-a-kind!

291
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,700
Sure, but these aren't my usual writing tools,

292
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,120
and it's on something other than paper.

293
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,850
If you want it done right,
you should ask a specialist...

294
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,330
What, yer tellin' me to head out t'sea
in some ugly mass-produced boat?!

295
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,870
No, I'm not!

296
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,290
But if I mess up, it'll be ugly anyway.

297
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,580
So, yer gonna mess up, Sensei?

298
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,340
No, I won't!

299
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,480
But I can't rule anything out...

300
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,550
Ain't nothin' to worry 'bout.

301
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,430
Now, get writin'!

302
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,680
But I told you...

303
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,470
Can a pro really be turnin' down work?

304
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,700
I'll decide what's ugly!

305
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,230
If I wanted to sail this out
with print-out writin' on it,

306
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,210
I'd have Naru do the job!

307
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,230
Now that's—

308
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,610
Okay, that's enough!

309
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,110
I've... sailed in to the rescue! Get it?

310
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,210
Dad, it's time for yer liquor deliveries.

311
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,430
Sensei, just whip somethin' up!

312
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,860
What're you sayin'?!

313
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,870
"Whip something up"?!

314
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,330
What d'you mean, "whip something up"?!

315
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,720
Like you always do!

316
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,840
C'mon! A liquor seller's gotta sell liquor!

317
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,710
What do you mean, "like I always do"?!

318
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,010
That  gangster dad's got me cornered!

319
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,600
Still, I'm not one to back away from
anything after being talked to like that!

320
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,830
I'll have him thanking me in tears!

321
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,070
That said, I really need to get
used to this kind of brush.

322
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,650
Sensei!

323
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,130
The paint won't come off!

324
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,270
Our hands'll melt!

325
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,270
Nah.

326
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,730
Relax, it won't melt your hands.

327
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,930
More importantly, is there anything
I can use for test writing?

328
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,320
Sensei!

329
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,570
There's lots of boards up here!

330
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,290
This is more than enough for test writing.

331
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,850
Thanks a lot.

332
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,090
Uh...

333
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,330
Yay!

334
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,150
What were their names, again?

335
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,420
It's easier than I expected.

336
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,570
I wanna write, too!

337
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,260
This is work.

338
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,470
Wait up!

339
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,340
Jacker Cyclone!

340
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,090
I'm mostly used to this brush now.

341
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,100
Summer Belly-Band Undersea Franken

342
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,800
My inner voice is really revealing itself, though...

343
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,900
Gangster Dad                                      Demon

344
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,650
Somehow, I have a feeling
I can write decent calligraphy.

345
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,750
Yuigadokuson-Maru (ha!) Gangster

346
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,650
Demon Aher    Phantom Gangster

347
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,650
Here I go!

348
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,770
Huh? Wait, I forgot to consider
the curvature of the hull!

349
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,590
Crap! At this rate...

350
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,500
I'll mess up!

351
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,720
That was close!

352
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,110
But now my neck hurts!

353
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,760
I'm glad, but my neck hurts!

354
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,620
I forgot to examine the hull!

355
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,150
I nearly messed up, !

356
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,720
All right, this area looks good...

357
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Don't push it!

358
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,640
We ain't doin' nothin'.

359
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,680
it, why?!

360
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,060
I did all that test writing!

361
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,780
Faced with this pure white boat,
I'm too scared to move the brush.

362
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,600
Won't I mess it up?

363
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,290
Oh, man... oh, man...

364
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,200
You okay, Sensei?

365
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,310
Ya better hurry before Miwa-nee gets back!

366
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,610
Shut up!

367
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,870
You're distracting me! Go away!

368
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,410
I hate this!

369
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,450
I'm scared... I'm scared... I'm scared...

370
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,400
He said he hates it.

371
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,960
Yeah.

372
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,990
Calm down, calm down!

373
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,080
I've been under pressure before.

374
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,740
It took a while before I
could write something good,

375
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,780
but I still pulled through when I had to.

376
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,930
I'll do it just like then...

377
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,270
I'm first!

378
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,170
All right! I'll do it, too!

379
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,200
Me, too!

380
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,200
And me!

381
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,620
What are you doing, you brats?!

382
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,140
What have you done?!

383
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,570
Now it's a mess!

384
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,970
Well, you were sayin' you hated it.

385
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,080
That's not what I meant!

386
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,460
I have to cover up the handprints.

387
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,700
It splattered me!

388
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,800
Deal with it! I got splashed, too!

389
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,810
I need to use strokes this bold
to cover up the handprints!

390
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,130
Naru! Put ink in the bowl!

391
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,810
Ayup!

392
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,370
Hina, stay back so your
clothes don't get dirty!

393
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,290
Aww...

394
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,180
Kenta, put paper beneath wherever
the ink's about to drip!

395
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,770
Ayup!

396
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,110
It's strange.

397
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,840
I was so scared just a moment ago,

398
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,720
but the pressure's completely gone,

399
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,390
and the brush is moving easily.

400
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,450
Just because of these little handprints...

401
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,350
Hurry up! I'm running out!

402
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,150
Ayup!

403
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,910
He's havin' a lot of fun, huh?

404
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,380
He's always like that.

405
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,210
Village Chief said he's a guy
who laughs while workin',

406
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,180
an' it looks to be true.

407
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,680
Here, take this seaweed as thanks.

408
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,020
All this?

409
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,490
Wait, isn't this the seaweed I just picked up?

410
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,380
How do I eat this?

411
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,520
Well, you did a great job.

412
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,840
I'll call when it's launchin' time,
so you better come see!

413
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,320
I didn't expect you to be this happy with it.

414
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,280
I'm mighty glad I asked you, Sensei.

415
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,540
It's more my boat than I ever imagined!

416
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,240
Good for you.

417
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,750
Over there's my hand—

418
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,770
It was difficult to write calligraphy on a boat,

419
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,090
so it was good experience.

420
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,570
Once I thought of it as soiling white paper,

421
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,330
that made it easy to do.

422
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,050
Thank you ever so much...

423
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,030
for entrusting this to me!

424
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,020
Nah, I thank you.

425
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,980
Well, setting that aside...

426
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,940
You've amassed quite a lot of
resentment toward me, haven't ya?

427
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,600
What brought this on?!

428
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,450
Summer Belly-Band Undersea Franken

429
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,450
Gangster Dad                                          Demon

430
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,450
Yuigadokuson-Maru (ha!) Gangster

431
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,450
Demon Aher    Phantom Gangster

432
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,550
Er, those were...

433
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,950
No worries, Sensei!

434
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,030
Those boards're meant for ferrying passengers.

435
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,800
What're you gonna do 'bout this?!

436
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,910
I...

437
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,370
I'm very sorry!

438
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,620
He ran away! Some adult!

439
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,830
Plus, he dropped his seaweed!

440
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,540
Sensei, yer seaweed!

441
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,720
Yer seaweed!

442
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,920
Yer seaweed!

443
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,440
Sensei!

444
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,240
There's a lot of trash around here.

445
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,530
Yeah, guys who come to fish
here just toss stuff away.

446
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,940
They don't heed warnings, either.

447
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,340
Why don't you try putting up
a well-phrased billboard?

448
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,190
"Because of your littering,
the world is coming to an end."

449
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,240
Too large-scale. It doesn't feel realistic.

450
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,190
"Don't toss out trash, you're trash."

451
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,440
That'll rub them the wrong way.

452
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,770
"Litter and you'll die."

453
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,960
Not enough.

454
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,560
Fine, you think of one!

455
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,300
"Litter here, and you'll fester
where the sun doesn't shine."

456
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,540
A dirty joke?!

457
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,680
If you litter, all the crayfish will go away.
