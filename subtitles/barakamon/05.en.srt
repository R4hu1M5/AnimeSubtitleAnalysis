1
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,990
It was difficult to write calligraphy on a boat,

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,280
so it was a good experience.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,770
Once I thought of it as soiling white paper,

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,480
that made it easy to do.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,200
Thanks to that, my brush feels less heavy now.

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,160
There's one month until the Naruka
Institute Calligraphy Exhibition.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,620
With a month, this time I should be...

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,840
Here! Eat up!

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,050
What is this?

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,570
Konomon.

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,630
Konomon?

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,760
All of this for me?

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,430
I'll come bringin' more when you run out.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,860
He really does come and
go through the back way.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,330
There's no way I can eat all
this pickled daikon myself.

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,450
It's good!

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,160
However, I need to focus on calligraphy now.

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,100
I'll use a more novel calligraphy style,

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,660
for an artistic konomon—

20
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,790
Not "konomon"!

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,890
I'll write!

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,420
I'll write on konomon—

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,170
Not "konomon"!

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,670
The Konomon Institute Calligraphy
Exhibition is next month—

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,670
Not "Konomon" Institute Calligraphy Exhibition!

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,680
Konomon!

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,430
Konomon.

28
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,100
Konomon!

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,100
Konomon

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,970
Konomon!

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,680
Barakamon

32
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,030
Un ni Oegii

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,030
Translation: Going Swimming at the Beach

34
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,320
Konomon... konomon...

35
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,490
Konomon... konomon...

36
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,270
Konomon... konomon...

37
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,660
Konomon?

38
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,760
I'll come bringin' more when you run out.

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,540
Konomon!

40
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,790
Teach us calligraphy!

41
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,960
It's you guys?!

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,920
That's awful rude of you.

43
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,100
Sorry.

44
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,930
Here.

45
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,640
Grampa said ya can never have
too much, an' told me to bring this.

46
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,050
Thank you...

47
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,940
Sensei, help us with our assignment.

48
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,150
First, hold the brush in your right hand.

49
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,260
This's my right hand!

50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,150
Exactly.

51
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,010
You can't do calligraphy left-handed?

52
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,460
It's not impossible, but inkstone
placement and such make it harder.

53
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,360
So, what's your assignment?

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,490
Let's see...

55
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,910
Learning From The Past

56
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,910
It's this.

57
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,040
Okay, I'll write the example, so watch closely.

58
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,380
That's too close.

59
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,050
You ain't writin' all fuzzy like usual?

60
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,010
Learning From
The Past

61
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,170
"Fuzzy"...?

62
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,010
Everything begins with the fundamentals.

63
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,360
I wanna do writin' like that.

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,410
It's real showy!

65
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,270
MU
(Nil)

66
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,270
Ah, I'm still perfecting that.

67
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,580
Once it's done and acknowledged,
then I'll instruct you in it.

68
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,730
Acknowledged? By whom?

69
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,440
Until I win grand prize at the Naruka Institute
Calligraphy Exhibition next month.

70
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,670
Even if it don't win a prize,
it looks plenty good to me.

71
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,000
Instead of fussin' over that stuff,
I'd rather have fun writin'.

72
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,000
Have fun, huh...

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,860
You three really are kids.

74
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,560
Here, you'll write this, Naru.

75
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,170
Yay! "Cat"!

76
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,630
All right!

77
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,540
Now that I'm your teacher,
you'll definitely win prizes.

78
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,750
Once you do, you're sure to understand why

79
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,850
I care so much about winning them.

80
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,060
You'll write for one full hour, starting now!

81
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,950
Focus.

82
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,910
You can't apply ink twice.

83
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,590
That stroke shouldn't trail off.

84
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,660
It should stop short.

85
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,250
Don't sleep!

86
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,840
Man, I'm pooped!

87
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Hey, all of you! No slacking off!

88
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,630
You're the ones who asked for my help.

89
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,790
I won't let you get less than grand prize.

90
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,750
But how many times are ya gonna make
us write the same thing over and over?

91
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,350
Isn't there a trick to writing well?

92
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,200
You're naïve!

93
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,400
Do you really think it's simple for
professionals to write beautifully?!

94
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,410
You need to understand the passion that
goes into a single sheet of calligraphy.

95
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,460
Thousands, millions, of predecessors

96
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,370
have committed trillions, quadrillions,
of thoughts to paper!

97
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,040
Like who?

98
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,070
Beats me.

99
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,450
Despite physical fatigue and mental breakdown...

100
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,440
You face the solitude single-mindedly!

101
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,920
Yes, the utmost limit.

102
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,750
You see the utmost limit!

103
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,010
Utmost limit...

104
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,160
With each step...

105
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,710
With each step, you get closer to perfection.

106
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,000
Yet an endless desert still stretches before you.

107
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,840
You can walk no further.
You're tired of writing.

108
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,270
The moment you think that,

109
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,220
you see it...

110
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,720
The God of Calligraphy!

111
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,960
However, even that god is just
another mirage in the desert!

112
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,190
Never seen anyone hallucinate
over calligraphy before.

113
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,290
Thing is,

114
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,050
we don't wanna go that far just
for a middle school assignment!

115
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,700
Go buy us some drinks!

116
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,910
I knew you guys had no motivation—

117
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,370
No, we do!

118
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,160
We do, so let us rest already!

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,480
Sheesh!

120
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,550
Be sure you keep practicing until I return!

121
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,050
All right, all right!

122
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,030
Sensei's an honest-to-goodness calligraphy nut.

123
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,550
Yah!

124
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,760
Ain't no way he can get a girlfriend like that.

125
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,090
I don't know...

126
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,900
He could have a long-distance relationship.

127
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,180
Girlfriend?!

128
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,170
Maybe I'll snoop around the room for evidence...

129
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,030
Cut it out. That's rude.

130
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,550
Kawafuji-san?

131
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,900
Could be his girlfriend!

132
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,110
Ah! Miwa-chan, don't just...

133
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,460
Oh, it's a man.

134
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,700
What? Let me see!

135
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,120
Why're you so interested?

136
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,040
A commemorative photo?

137
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,500
Maybe he's datin' one of 'em.

138
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,060
How 'bout her?

139
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,000
She's pretty, but she's standing kinda far from him.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,130
Maybe this one?

141
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,210
Ain't she too plain to be Sensei's girlfriend?

142
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,420
Why would her looks matter?

143
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,070
As long as she can talk about
calligraphy, that's enough.

144
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,260
Ya really think there's a woman
who'd listen to his delusions?

145
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,930
By golly!

146
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,240
If it's just listening,
even a monkey could do it.

147
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,220
Here!

148
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,760
What's wrong, Naru?

149
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,230
Sensei said this's his treasure.

150
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,460
What is it?

151
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,870
A picture frame?

152
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,780
I bet there's a picture of his sweetheart in it!

153
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,960
What's wrong?

154
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,810
I just can't believe Sensei's a married woman!

155
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,440
Naru, that's not how you use that phrase.

156
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,980
Naru sure does love Sensei a lot.

157
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,370
C'mon, don't worry.

158
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,800
At his age, it'd be weirder
if he'd never dated a woman.

159
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,070
In another ten years,
you'll be the beauty, Naru.

160
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,700
You can appropriate him then.

161
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,760
"Up-rope-ree-ate"?

162
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,560
Now, let's take a look!

163
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,180
At Sensei's girlfriend!

164
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Su
Shi

165
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,690
I bought your drinks.

166
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,780
Hey, what are you girls doing?!

167
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,070
If you don't straighten up, you won't
win anything, much less grand prize!

168
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,320
You're already 23 years old, Sensei!

169
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,240
Look at other things besides calligraphy!

170
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,200
What're you thinkin', gettin'
turned on by historical figures?!

171
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,870
Come back to reality!

172
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,740
Sensei, you should go out with Naru.

173
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,100
By golly!

174
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,590
Me, me! I'll up-rope-ree-ate you!

175
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,410
Appropriate?

176
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,590
Uh, hey!

177
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,090
Sto—

178
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,690
Yer gonna die alone at this rate!

179
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,030
What do you mean?!

180
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,090
Up-rope-ree-ate!

181
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,750
And what are you talking about?!

182
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,650
An ocean swim?

183
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,870
The kids are going on a trip to the beach,
and I'd like you to chaperone.

184
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,150
I asked their teacher first, but...

185
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,430
I'm goin' fishin'!

186
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,340
Oh...

187
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,630
They all can swim, right?

188
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,870
If I just have to watch them, that's fine.

189
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,200
Well, actually...

190
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,980
It seems Miwa and Tama are going, too.

191
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,020
Please make sure they don't
do anything dangerous.

192
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm having our Hiroshi go
along, too, just in case...

193
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,340
This sounds like a real pain.

194
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,260
Hurry, Sensei!

195
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,050
Okay.

196
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,470
C'mon, hurry!

197
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,170
Wait a moment!

198
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,440
Sensei, hurry, hurry!

199
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,990
Okay, I got it!

200
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,940
Get ready!

201
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,690
Butt j—

202
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,690
Don't you dare!

203
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,830
Hey, don't run around!

204
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,490
It's Miwa-nee and Tama!

205
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,960
Mornin', Naru!

206
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,410
Yer late, Sensei!

207
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,530
Thanks for coming today!

208
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,950
What are you two wearing?

209
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,150
Those look like gym clothes.

210
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,280
Not just "like" 'em. They are gym clothes.

211
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
They're the best for swimmin'.

212
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,230
You're swimming in those?!

213
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,170
Well, yeah.

214
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,930
Isn't it hard to swim in regular clothes?

215
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,640
You strip down if ya like, Sensei.

216
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,910
Uh, no, I don't have a swimsuit.

217
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,340
C'mon! I said to hurry!

218
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,570
Hey, wait!

219
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,080
Hiro isn't here ye—

220
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,630
Okay, let's go.

221
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,480
Come on, kids, stick with Hiro-nii!

222
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,230
Okay!

223
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,690
This guy's just coming for fun, isn't he?

224
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,920
Let's go, everybody!

225
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,110
Today I'm gonna master the backstroke!

226
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,240
Hey!

227
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,480
Don't race around too much!

228
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,340
Don't worry.

229
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,180
We come to this beach every year.

230
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,270
It's too rocky to be a beach.

231
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,130
Play somewhere safer, like a sandy beach.

232
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,170
Sandy beaches are for little kids.

233
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,550
That's the point!

234
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,390
The footing... is really bad...

235
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,480
Sensei, what are you doing?!

236
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,900
Man, this is what's wrong with city slickers.

237
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,060
Will he be all right?

238
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,650
He oughta be fine.

239
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,530
Everyone uses this path.

240
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,090
All right, dive in!

241
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,410
Yeah!

242
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,820
Huh?

243
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,080
Woah, those're big!

244
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,710
Sea urchin!

245
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,920
Sea urchin!

246
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,710
Take that!

247
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,830
Cut it out, Naru!

248
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,380
Hey!

249
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,260
Find any neat fish, Hina?

250
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,510
Yeah, but the goggles keep
fogging up and I can't see them.

251
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,590
When that happens, wipe it with mugwort.

252
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,190
I keep mugwort leaves in here.

253
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,980
Mugwort extract helps prevent foggin'.

254
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,110
Wow!

255
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,050
Naru, you know everything!

256
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,690
You're like Gramma...

257
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,190
What d'ya mean, "Gramma"?

258
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,330
Oh, sorry... You didn't like that?

259
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,470
'Course not!

260
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,110
I'm only seven!

261
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,830
I'm sorry!

262
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,460
Sheesh, that's the problem with kids.

263
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,260
They just dunno how to enjoy the beach.

264
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,750
I see one! Take this!

265
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,060
Hiroshi Critical!

266
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,520
Woah! It's an octopus!

267
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,370
I got it!

268
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,090
Hiro-nii, yer so cool!

269
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,810
Hiro-nii, yer so uncool!

270
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,160
Sheesh, boys just dunno
how to play at the beach.

271
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,260
Sorry, Miwa-chan.

272
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,140
I'm a little tired.

273
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,320
You all right?

274
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,780
Don't go overdoin' it.

275
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,970
I'm going to rest a bit over by Sensei.

276
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,900
Sure.

277
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,100
Hey!

278
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,110
Are you all right, Tama?!

279
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,150
Your face is red!

280
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,880
Sorry about this.

281
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,940
I'm more the indoors type.

282
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,540
If you're the indoors type, then settle down.

283
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,910
Have some water for now.

284
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,530
Can you drink?

285
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,900
Yes.

286
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,840
What is this? I feel like
she's really staring at me.

287
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,980
Sensei...

288
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,960
Have you ever been so worried about
something, you couldn't sleep at night?

289
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,210
What's the matter?

290
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,190
Are you worried about something?

291
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,770
Not worried, exactly.

292
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,850
I'll be frank. What do you think about Hiro-nii?

293
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,480
Hiro?

294
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,890
What's this about?

295
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,250
Here we go!

296
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,250
I'm not sure what I think of him.

297
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,200
Ready, set, go!

298
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,360
He's close in age, and easy to talk
to, so... like a brother, I guess?

299
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,790
No... we're not that close.

300
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,070
He's just the guy who brings me my food.

301
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,300
Hold on...

302
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,030
Why would this glasses girl
be asking me such a thing?

303
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,000
I know!

304
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,620
She must have a crush on Hiro!

305
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,460
Now I get it. That's why she's
been acting so odd lately.

306
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,010
Though I'm not perfect, she still sees
me as a mentor, and wants my advice.

307
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,480
She does have her cute side.

308
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,890
Sensei?

309
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
I'll support them as much as I can.

310
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,270
Hiro's a great guy.

311
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,350
He's thoughtful, a good cook...

312
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,650
You don't often see such a great young man.

313
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,480
He's the perfect guy to go out w—

314
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,940
That's enough!

315
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,740
Whose fault do you think it is that
I'm having these sleepless nights?

316
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,710
I'm not one of those nasty fujoshi!

317
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,880
"Fujoshi"?

318
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,830
What do you mean?

319
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,960
Don't run like that!

320
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,860
It's dangero—

321
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,000
Sen... sei?

322
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,960
You're kidding, right?

323
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,380
Ta-da!

324
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,110
Look here, Naru!

325
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,880
It's a sea slug!

326
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,210
Woah! You're pretty daring to grab that.

327
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,770
You try holdin' it, Naru.

328
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,710
If you can hold it, yer an adult.

329
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,810
Adult...

330
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,470
Miwa-nee, yer mean!

331
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,470
Yer face makes me sick!

332
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,910
Sorry, sorry.

333
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,830
It's gross, but it's fine once ya get used to it.

334
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,290
It's all squishy!

335
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,510
I'm used to it!

336
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,300
Yep. That means yer an adult.

337
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,750
Hiro-nii, how's Sensei?

338
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,720
Oh...

339
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,830
Ah! How useless can you be?

340
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,830
Looks like he's still unconscious.

341
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,680
Okay, then that's good.

342
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,740
Naru!

343
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,960
Let's go someplace real fun.

344
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,480
Someplace real fun?

345
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,680
Yep, one that only adults can go to.

346
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,290
Oh, crap.

347
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,320
I blacked out again.

348
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,520
We should probably head back...

349
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,040
We haven't had lunch yet.

350
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,040
Hey, kids!

351
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,560
Time to get out!

352
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,030
What, already?

353
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,030
We're still playin'!

354
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,710
I knew they'd complain.

355
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,510
Hey!

356
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,340
Where's Naru?!

357
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,270
She was with Miwa-chan just a second ago.

358
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,720
Over there.

359
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,290
Here I go!

360
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,400
Miwa?!

361
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,110
That's dangerous! Stop it!

362
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,310
Ah, that's fun!

363
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,540
Hey, Miwa.

364
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,410
Sensei's sayin' something.

365
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,060
Yer right.

366
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,460
Maybe we should head back?

367
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,560
After one more jump, then?

368
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,860
Yeah.

369
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,920
But first...

370
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,880
Hey, Naru!

371
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,410
C'mon!

372
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,260
Hey! Wait! Hold it right there!

373
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,970
Why are you—

374
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,600
Stop! Naru!

375
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,350
Naru!

376
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,420
That was fun!

377
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,010
You done good!

378
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,950
That's my protégé for ya!

379
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,660
When I jumped, I heard Sensei cheerin' me on.

380
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,300
He yelled, "Naru!"

381
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,820
That's why I wasn't scared at all!

382
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,380
Cheering?

383
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,630
Now that you mention it,
he was sayin' somethin'.

384
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,590
Sensei?!

385
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,200
Hey... Sensei!

386
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,380
Honestly!

387
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,140
You did nothing but dangerous stuff!

388
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,750
Sorry, Sensei.

389
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,720
We won't do it no more, so don't be mad.

390
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,880
Hey, c'mon...

391
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,110
Sensei!

392
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,940
I've never felt like this before.

393
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,760
Before I came to this island, all I ever
really had to worry about was myself.

394
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,370
This is the first time I've been
so worried about someone else!

395
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,190
!

396
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,460
I'm going home!

397
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,560
Sensei!

398
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,360
Hey...

399
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,130
Sensei, I won't make you worry again!

400
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,390
Me neither!

401
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,550
Me either!

402
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,320
Me neither!

403
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,960
You guys...

404
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,180
Sensei!

405
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,880
I won't do nothin' dangerous no more!

406
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,200
I won't either!

407
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,200
Sensei! Sensei! Sensei!

408
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,170
The outsider's totally one of the gang now.

409
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,500
Stare...

410
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,370
Don't expect me to join in.

411
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,050
Sigh

412
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,310
Aww...

413
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,700
Don't look disappointed!

414
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,180
Cool
Breeze

415
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,570
Missed Call   1
Kawafuji

416
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,530
Fukue Airport

417
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,330
No use...

418
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,530
He's not answering his cell.

419
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,040
Out of
Range

420
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,100
I'm out of range again.

421
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,040
What'll we do?

422
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,030
Sheesh, this place is inconvenient.

423
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,880
I kinda like it here.

424
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,710
It's like everything is miniature. Teeny-weeny!

425
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,420
Kyousuke, are you making fun of it?

426
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,890
It's fine.

427
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,050
I'll go anywhere,

428
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,070
to meet Handa-san.

429
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,780
Miwa-chan! Miwa-chan!

430
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,370
Your hair's really wild!

431
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,080
It's 'cuz it's been so humid lately.

432
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,420
You always did have unruly hair.

433
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,460
Scruffy

434
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,750
He's just like me!

435
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,890
Oh, did you girls come to fish, too?

436
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,380
Sensei, your hair is intense...

437
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Really?

438
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,060
It gets like this when I'm in good condition.

439
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,900
No, ain't it 'cuz of the humidity?

440
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,410
You both have similar hair qualities.

441
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,890
Even your hairstyle's the same.

442
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,140
Sensei, don't copy me!

443
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,360
"Copy"...

444
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,430
Maybe try goin' close-cropped?

445
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,540
No, that won't look good on me.

446
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,110
Oh, there's a bunch here today!

447
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,270
Mind if yer teacher joins ya?

448
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,330
Scruffy

449
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,330
Boy, it's tough when it's this muggy.

450
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,110
The same as the teacher?!

451
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,800
So glad I have straight hair...

452
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,080
Just close-cropped isn't enough,

453
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,790
obviously...

454
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,720
Ya got tengusa head!

455
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,590
Huh?

456
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,970
Tengusa
(red algae)
