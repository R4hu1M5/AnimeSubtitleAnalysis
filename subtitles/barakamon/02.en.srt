1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,080
Three...

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,630
Three...

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,240
Three...

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,320
I've been studyin' real seriously...

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,000
Nobody understands that.

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,810
You've got exams this year.

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,320
Try a little harder.

8
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,030
Run a little longer!

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,330
You need to sing a little louder.

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,140
That's what I'm doin'!

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,530
Chin up, Hiroshi.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,130
Don't just barge in!

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,070
Nothin' wrong with gettin' all threes.

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,380
Yer pa got all threes, too!

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,490
That's right!

16
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,930
Yer already on the track to mediocrity!

17
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,660
Bein' mediocre just makes ya unique, right?

18
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,950
If ya don't need somethin', get out!

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,490
We do need you to do somethin'.

20
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,270
Here.

21
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,480
Take this champon to Sensei.

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,660
Y'know, shouldn't you reconsider this?

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,160
Ain't no need for you to
be cookin' for a stranger.

24
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,580
I'm gonna tell him, "Cook your own food."

25
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,090
You don't understand nothin'!

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,570
Don't you realize how doin' things for
Sensei gives your mother purpose?

27
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,650
With a son who can care for himself,

28
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,570
and a lethargic husband who just says
"s'good" no matter what I feed him...

29
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,300
In a life with no challenges,

30
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:31,090
only Sensei's existence revives my
heart as a mother, and as a woman...

31
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,690
Barakamon

32
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,960
Yakamashika

33
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,960
Translation:
Annoying

34
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,710
It's been a week since I came to this island.

35
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,300
I still haven't written anything I'm satisfied with...

36
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,470
That was just spur of the moment.

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,470
FUN

38
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,010
I can't call it my own style.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,720
I came here to immerse myself in writing,

40
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,890
and to triumph over that man...

41
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,780
Focus...

42
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,070
Sensei!

43
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,950
You again? Why do you come here every day?

44
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,890
'Cuz I'm yer commuter wife!

45
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,690
Where did you learn that?

46
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,750
Hello!

47
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,950
It's Miwa-nee and Tama!

48
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,580
Ooh! So this's the guy!

49
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,840
I've never seen someone in a
stylish jinbei like that before.

50
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,210
Ain't been to the base in a while.

51
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,060
Hey! Don't come in without permission!

52
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,430
Augh! The posters're all torn down!

53
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,990
The CDs are gone, too.

54
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,300
Hey!

55
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,220
What are you doing, barging in here?

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,460
Yer the one who barged in!

57
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,970
This was our base!

58
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,770
Anyway, where's our stuff?

59
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,310
Don't tell me you pitched it!

60
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,870
The stuff that was in here when
I moved in is all inside in that box.

61
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,240
Oh, good!

62
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,860
These're important to us, y'know.

63
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,570
Look, this isn't your base anymore.

64
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,010
Hey!

65
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,540
What are you putting up?!

66
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,410
We ain't got no mind to leave here.

67
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,670
Well, leave! Someone lives here now!

68
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,270
Don't be so uptight!

69
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,050
You know yer happy to be mixin' with young girls.

70
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,720
Don't say stuff that's easily misunderstood!

71
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,390
It was you, wasn't it?!

72
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,970
You taught this child all those indecent words!

73
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,270
That lady's the queen of Kabuki-cho!

74
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,840
Since it's nice out, I'll go streetwalking!

75
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,730
This miso soup is labial!

76
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,520
You should be more careful from now on.

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,640
Tellin' us that won't do any good.

78
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,910
Yeah!

79
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,560
Ya just memorized stuff ya
overheard us sayin', right?

80
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,620
Yep, no one taught me nothin'.

81
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,030
You be careful too, Sensei.

82
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,000
Kids her age parrot phrases like a myna bird.

83
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,960
I'm saying, the language you use is—

84
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,180
"Esu Emu"?

85
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,090
Wait, Naru!

86
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,020
I wrote that for work.

87
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,140
Meanin' it's for an S&M Club, right?

88
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,070
No, it's not!

89
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,550
Esu Emu!

90
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,140
Esu Emu! Esu Emu!

91
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,190
Esunic (Ethnic) Restaurant
Emupamuuza

92
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,440
Esunic (Ethnic) Restaurant
Emupamuuza

93
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,440
This is for a restaurant signboard!

94
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,700
What're you makin', Tama?

95
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,940
Hey! Don't use my calligraphy
tools without permission!

96
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,990
All done!

97
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,070
Ta-da!

98
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,070
Loser

99
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:55,910
Loser

100
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,070
Write something nicer!

101
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,960
Yer real good, Tama!

102
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,790
Yeah, really!

103
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,910
I can tell you're aimin' to write manga.

104
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,640
Don't talk about me wantin' to write manga!

105
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,720
You may be better'n Sensei!

106
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,020
Hey, yeah!

107
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,550
Maybe it's actually easy to become a calligrapher!

108
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Don't underestimate me, brats!

109
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,970
LOSER

110
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,240
Look! This is real calligraphy!

111
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:29,570
LOSER

112
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,310
Amazin'!

113
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,830
Don't quite get why, though.

114
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,350
Yeah, I don't really get it, either.

115
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,950
There's a penmanship assignment
in our summer homework.

116
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,890
Let's have Sensei look at it.

117
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,050
Nice idea!

118
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,990
If I learn from Sensei, a big
prize won't be just a dream.

119
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,570
So, please help us out, Sensei!

120
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,660
All right! Leave it to me!

121
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,220
Okay! We'll come back tomorrow!

122
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,240
Bye-bye!

123
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,040
!

124
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,290
What have I done?!

125
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
And those feelings

126
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,360
excite your mother as a woman...

127
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,900
Ah, I get it already! I'm goin'!

128
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,260
Focus...

129
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,930
Sensei!

130
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,400
I brought Hina this time!

131
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,630
You know,

132
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,960
I don't have time to play right now!

133
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,580
Go play outside!

134
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,260
Focus, focus...

135
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,110
If I ignore them, they'll leave eventually...

136
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,100
Mosquito.

137
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,130
There!

138
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,230
Hey! Hold it!

139
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,140
I forgot somethin'...

140
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,950
This's fun!

141
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,970
S&M...

142
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,380
No, it's not!

143
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,010
Don't come back today, any of you!

144
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,840
Poo.

145
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,750
This is bad... I feel dizzy...

146
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,460
Sheesh...

147
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,060
We're stuck dealin' with some guy
too old to be this high-maintenance.

148
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,340
A calligrapher's gotta be a real snobby jerk.

149
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,120
I hafta make it clear we
can't go on feedin' him.

150
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,620
Hey! I know you're there!

151
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,470
Come out already!

152
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,270
Listen, jerk! Answer when someone's calli—

153
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,830
Hey...

154
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,360
I'm back!

155
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,980
Hiroshi! What're you doin' to Sensei?!

156
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,330
I ain't doin' nothin'!

157
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,570
What do I do?

158
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,960
Just take the champon!

159
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:51,960
All right!

160
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,680
Everyone! Lend me your energy!

161
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,970
I said take the champon!

162
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,440
Good thing it's wrapped.

163
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,760
Yeah...

164
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,780
Don't look so great, though.

165
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,440
Still, why's he on the verge of death?

166
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,410
He's always like that this time of day.

167
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,880
He's been writin' stuff for
a calligraphy contest.

168
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,400
Up all night, huh?

169
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,240
I get like that before tests, too.

170
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,660
Well, between me and a guy with talent,
I guess all-nighters don't mean the same.

171
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,050
Hiroshi, what's "talent"?

172
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,160
It's when a guy can do anything
with just a little effort,

173
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,400
when a guy like me can't do nothin'
no matter how hard he tries.

174
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,850
Did you get all threes even though ya tried hard?

175
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,440
Hey, who'd you hear that from?!

176
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,670
Woohoo!

177
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,520
I feel like workin' hard, too!

178
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,360
Who told you that?!

179
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,980
By golly!

180
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,190
Ain't nobody who can beat me at that!

181
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,300
Hey!

182
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,320
Listen to me!

183
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,780
It's hidden in this room.

184
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,120
Hey, now...

185
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,620
Just bargin' into a room is—

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,040
What's with this room?

187
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,720
I'm pretty sure it's in that box.

188
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,460
Hold it, Naru!

189
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,300
You see, Sensei

190
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,300
says he still can't write nothin' good
even after writin' all this.

191
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,940
Because Sensei ain't got talent,

192
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,680
even after writin' lots,
he thinks it's not enough.

193
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,680
UTMOST

194
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,840
I think Sensei's amazin', but I
don't much understand "talent."

195
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,070
I've studied this much already. That's enough.

196
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,770
You dyed your hair?

197
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,850
Yeah. I'm goin' with this style from now on.

198
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,990
You sure do everything half-assed.

199
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,200
I do everything half-assed...

200
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,740
So that's why I get all threes...

201
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,730
Hiroshi?

202
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,130
Naru, on second thought,
Sensei really does have talent.

203
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,420
What?

204
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,120
You can tell, Hiroshi?

205
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,320
No, I don't actually get it.

206
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,560
What?

207
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,550
You were fakin'?!

208
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,750
Being able to work hard
is the best talent of all.

209
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,110
Oh! Hiroshi, you cryin'?

210
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,570
No, I'm not!

211
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,530
Liar! Yer definitely cryin'!
And yer a grown-up!

212
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,990
Shut up! Don't look at me!

213
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,380
What was that?!

214
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,580
Ta-da!

215
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,750
Cicada shells!

216
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,900
Why?

217
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,500
It's my talent.

218
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,090
Nobody can beat me at collectin' these.

219
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,970
That's talent, right?

220
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,640
Well...

221
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,770
If you try with all your might
so nobody can beat you,

222
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,810
that might be talent.

223
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,950
Oh, so you're the Village Chief's son.

224
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,660
Sorry to have you all do so much for me.

225
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,500
Uh...

226
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,990
This is the last time we can bring you food.

227
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,560
Ma won't say it, but I think
you've gotten to be a burden.

228
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,080
I've been a burden?

229
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,520
Besides, I plan to study seriously
for my exams from now on.

230
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,120
I'd like to try following your example,
and make a proper effort.

231
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,780
I really like your mom's meat and potato
stew, but I guess it can't be helped.

232
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,520
Have you been listening to me?

233
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,230
Okay.

234
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,970
I'll bring you some homemade
meat and potato stew for dinner.

235
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,730
No, that's not what I meant...

236
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,270
I'd feel bad if that messy champon
was your last meal from us.

237
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,940
Later!

238
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,800
I have to start cooking for myself tomorrow?

239
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,530
Sensei, you gonna make rice or somethin'?

240
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,030
Maybe I'll make curry.

241
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,620
Yeah!

242
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,110
Sensei!

243
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,340
I came to play again—

244
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,490
Sensei!

245
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,560
Am-ambulance!

246
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,680
Nanatsutake Hospital

247
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,680
Handa Sei
Private Room

248
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,680
Heatstroke, sleep deprivation, poor appetite...

249
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,420
I'm admitting you for one night.

250
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,340
Okay...

251
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,630
For goodness' sake, Sensei, why didn't
you say you weren't feelin' well?

252
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,980
I'm sorry.

253
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,940
I kind of ended up with insomnia.

254
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,370
Sensei, will you get better?

255
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,030
Yeah, I'm hooked up to an IV, so I'll be fine.

256
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,680
Huh...

257
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,740
Does it hurt worse'n a shot?

258
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm not sure...

259
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,690
Well, Sensei.

260
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,030
We'll fetch what you need
for stayin' the night here.

261
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,770
Uh, right.

262
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,680
If you need anything,
feel free to call on Iku-chan.

263
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,570
This here nurse may be young,
but she's a married woman.

264
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,670
Don't go puttin' hands on her.

265
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,390
Like I'd want to do that.

266
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,230
Sensei...

267
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,670
Did you know shots hurt worse than IVs?

268
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,410
Now I've done it.

269
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,970
I guess I've been pretty tense.

270
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,930
I have to get back to writing soon.

271
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,350
And what are you still doing here?

272
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,270
Vroom!

273
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,420
Put down the toy car and listen!

274
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,940
Oh, here it is!

275
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,930
'Scuse us!

276
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,670
You all right, Sensei?

277
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,440
We came to wish you well.

278
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,390
You girls came all this way to see me?

279
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,230
It's a school day, see.

280
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,770
Our middle school's near here.

281
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,140
Oh, so I'm just a side trip.

282
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,060
That's still nice though, ain't it?

283
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,280
Sensei, your IV's about to run out!

284
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,030
What?!

285
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,240
Won't it just refill itself
once the bag runs out?

286
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,410
It's nothin' that high-tech!

287
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,540
Naru! Use the nurse-call!

288
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,710
Nasu (eggplant)?

289
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,570
There ain't no nasu here!

290
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:08,840
Nasu! Nasu! Nasu, nasu, nasu!

291
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,440
If you don't call Iku-neechan soon,

292
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,840
air will get into Sensei's arm and he'll die!

293
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:21,060
Handa Sei
Private Room

294
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,670
But there's no nasu!

295
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,380
The button's right by his pillow!

296
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,850
Pillow-talk! Pillow-talk!

297
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,680
Ack, Sensei fainted!

298
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,620
He's spineless!

299
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,900
There was no need to panic.

300
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,270
The recent models won't let air get in.

301
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,450
Oh, yeah? I had no idea!

302
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,780
Give me a break!

303
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,810
I was already in bad shape.

304
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,110
Sensei, your temperature has gone up a little.

305
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,400
Shall I insert a suppository to lower it?

306
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,490
Suppository?!

307
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,250
Why're you reacting, too?

308
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,560
No!

309
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,850
I refuse to engage in humiliation-play!

310
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,740
Humiliation-play?

311
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,470
This is standard medical care.

312
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,510
When that was done to
me back in grade school,

313
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,300
I got so embarrassed that I threw up...

314
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,060
You don't need to confess your trauma to me.

315
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,950
We'll keep him under observation for now.

316
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,440
Girls, don't go gettin' him overexcited.

317
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,100
Okay!

318
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,670
Huh?

319
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,450
Where's Naru?

320
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,400
What're you doin' down here?

321
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,980
Come out of there.

322
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,430
You'll dirty your clothes.

323
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,350
No!

324
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,320
I'll be sure to press it next time.

325
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,630
If anything happens to Sensei,
I'll press the nasu!

326
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,190
Look, the IV's all full now.

327
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,090
Nothing's gonna happen for a while!

328
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,430
But...

329
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,090
There's a ghost here...

330
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,820
A ghost?

331
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,680
Grampa told me

332
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,790
that there's a ghost in this hospital.

333
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,530
It's scarier'n a monster.

334
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,920
Nobody knows what it is.

335
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,030
Truth is, I'm scared, but...

336
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,530
I wanna see it just once!

337
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,790
Her grampa totally made that up.

338
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,190
What're you doin'?

339
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,050
I'm not listening to you guys.

340
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,830
I don't believe in ghosts.

341
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,190
What'll you do if I hear you talking about
scary stuff and can't sleep tonight?

342
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,240
This hospital is old, so it's really scary!

343
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,920
How 'bout a suppository?

344
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,670
Why'd you flinch?

345
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,050
'Sup?

346
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,850
I brought the stuff you asked for.

347
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,640
And my writing tools?

348
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,050
No way.

349
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,000
Why not?!

350
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,890
I've been waiting for those!

351
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,710
You just collapsed from overwork!

352
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,840
You need to rest!

353
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,750
I'm most relaxed when I'm working!

354
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,780
Are you stupid? I'm worried about you!

355
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,390
Your eyes are goin' wild!

356
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,740
What did you say?!

357
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,740
What's the matter?!

358
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,530
Okay, time for us to be headin' home.

359
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,000
Later!

360
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,350
Bye-bye!

361
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Guess I'll go back...

362
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,980
Hello there.

363
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,230
Oh, uh, hello there.

364
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,630
Did I startle you?

365
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,320
Just a little.

366
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,350
I'm in the room next to yours.

367
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,450
Sounded mighty lively in there earlier.

368
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,940
I'm very sorry. Did we bother you?

369
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,060
Oh, no, no.

370
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,000
So, what's ailin' you?

371
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,780
Nothing that bad, really.

372
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,910
Just a summer cold.

373
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,660
Can't be "just a cold."

374
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,180
Weren't they all worried about you?

375
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:30,580
Those kids seemed mighty relieved
when they heard you were safe.

376
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,960
Please get to feelin' better soon.

377
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,270
HEARTBEAT

378
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,230
Handa-san?!

379
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,150
What are you doing?!

380
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,820
Please tell the Village Chief
to bring me my writing tools!

381
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,600
Your fever hasn't gone down yet!

382
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,380
It's now or never!

383
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,080
I have to write while the idea's still fresh!

384
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,410
I'm begging you!

385
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,510
Please let me write!

386
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,790
Come on!

387
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,790
No!

388
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,920
I have to write it now!

389
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,200
Stop, Sensei!

390
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,120
One moment is everything!

391
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,850
No! You can't, Sensei!

392
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,090
I have a husband!

393
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,510
Sorry 'bout this.

394
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,980
I thought you should know.

395
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,140
His fever's gone up from excitement,
so I'll give him a suppository for sleepin'.

396
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,690
Sensei!

397
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,790
You all better now?

398
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,930
Yeah. See for yourself.

399
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,490
Ooh, thank goodness!

400
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,410
Your color does look a lot better.

401
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,110
It's thanks to the sposi-tree!

402
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,600
I'll fill your prescriptions.
Be sure to take them as directed.

403
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,910
Why are you so far away?

404
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,440
Don't test my love for my husband!

405
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,840
Like I said, why?!

406
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,670
Now to hurry back so I can write!

407
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,730
Oh, you're raring to go, eh?

408
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,730
The old man in the room next to mine
really cheered me up yesterday.

409
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,730
He's in this room... Hm?

410
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,460
Uh, where's the old man who was in this room?

411
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,730
Old man?

412
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,840
You were the only patient here yesterday.

413
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,400
Most folks just go to the new facility.

414
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,370
Huh...

415
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,670
Sensei, did ya see a ghost?

416
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,450
Sensei!

417
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,720
Hello?

418
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,040
I brought meat and potato stew!

419
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,500
What'd you do to your hands?!

420
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,440
Uh, it's nothing!

421
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,100
Nothing at all!

422
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,280
Sensei!

423
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,950
What do I do with these
blood-soaked onions you cut?

424
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,950
That's not blood!

425
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,750
It's a spice! Like Tabasco!
That's what the red stuff is!

426
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Ma, I get the feeling I understand
what you were talking about now.

427
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,080
We'll continue to bring
you food from now on.

428
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,720
Huh?! Are you sure?!

429
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,630
Ain't that great, Sensei?
