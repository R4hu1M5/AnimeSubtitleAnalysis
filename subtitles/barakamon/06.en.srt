1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,400
Hey! Come one, come all!

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,940
Cigarettes

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,940
I got shells for sale!

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,440
20
yen

5
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,980
Step right up!

6
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,240
His place should be around here.

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,150
Please make sure to find him today!

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,990
I'm sick of spending the night at campsites.

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,200
Yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,700
20 yen

11
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,700
What the heck is this?

12
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,740
I got shells for sale!

13
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,620
Step right up!

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,460
Gramma!

15
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,010
Oh, she's back.

16
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,380
Hey, step right up!

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,380
Dog

18
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,130
Why so competitive?

19
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,120
Playing shop keeper, huh?

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,100
What're you selling?

21
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,840
Shells.

22
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,510
May I have one, too?

23
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,350
Yes, here.

24
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,980
You like children?

25
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,010
For publicity's sake.

26
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,200
You're a pretty nasty guy.

27
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,190
Do you dislike them, Kawafuji-san?

28
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,590
I think I'd come to like her,
given another ten years.

29
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,910
That's not liking children, that's liking women.

30
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,370
Furthermore, I prefer mature women.

31
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,890
That's gross!

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,990
What're you doing?

33
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,960
Yuck, now my hand's slimy! It's filthy!

34
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,960
You trying to break my glasses?!

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,670
You dig it out with a needle like this, and eat it.

36
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,630
*Good children boil them before eating!

37
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,630
Ick ick ick!

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,060
Young lady...

39
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,510
Does someone named Handa
Seishuu live around here?

40
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,910
Handa...

41
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,580
Seishuu...

42
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,390
Not around here.

43
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,900
Wha? No way!

44
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,530
But...

45
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,460
there's a Sensei who goes
by a stylish name like that.

46
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,750
Sensei?

47
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,980
Our penmanship teacher.

48
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,540
Yeah, that's him!

49
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,780
Do you know where Handa-sensei's house is?

50
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,320
I'll tell you if you buy a shell.

51
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,970
Very shrewd...

52
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,970
Okay, sell me that one.

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,000
You have fine judgment, sir.

54
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,990
But, I can only sell this to someone wealthy,
like an eye-tea company head or major leaguer.

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,630
Well then.....

56
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,050
Would you accept this card?

57
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,510
C-Card?!

58
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,000
How much are you willing to sell for?

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,130
Since I want you to show me the way, I'll splurge.

60
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,970
I, I—

61
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,580
I'll give you a deal at a million yen, you thief!

62
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,170
That's not a deal at all.

63
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,560
Don't call me a thief.

64
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,170
It's my first time seein' one.

65
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,360
So, this is a card...

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,370
Here.

67
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,680
All right, young lady!

68
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,530
Show me the way to—

69
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,620
Wait, I'm gonna show this to Gramma.

70
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,450
Hold it! This comes first.

71
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,560
Stop it!

72
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,480
Let me go!

73
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,770
Hurry up and take me—

74
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,040
Where're you guys from?

75
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,620
Uh... well...

76
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,100
What's goin' on, Teacher?

77
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,170
They're suspicious.

78
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,680
Snatchin' a child?

79
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,950
Ya got tattoos.

80
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,420
Uh, that's not what's going on...

81
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,770
Call the fire brigade.

82
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,800
We got a village meetin' now.

83
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,040
Won't ya come tell us all 'bout it?

84
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,550
Get movin'!

85
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,790
Wait!

86
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,020
Kawafuji-san!

87
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,720
Barakamon

88
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,990
Yosonmon

89
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,990
Translation:
Guys From Tokyo

90
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,030
Thank you for this food.

91
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Thank you for this food.

92
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,740
Thank you for this food!

93
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,450
Wait, why are you guys
eating dinner at my house?

94
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,730
Dad and Mom went to the community
center for the village meeting.

95
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,790
Grampa, too.

96
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,130
And it's tastier than when eating alone, right?

97
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:40,710
Right?

98
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,430
I prefer eating alone.

99
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,110
Sensei, you've gained weight
since you came to the island.

100
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,080
No way!

101
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,640
Seriously.

102
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,600
The languid country air is ruining me!

103
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,520
A man oughta be a little plump.

104
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,210
You know, I've been wondering
about this for a while.

105
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,030
What's this scribbling?

106
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,030
Dog

107
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,690
Earlier, I met a fella with scribblin' on his arm.

108
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,660
Probably shady.

109
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,080
"Scribbling"? Isn't that a tattoo?

110
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,920
A flower and "Dog" and...

111
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,330
Dog

112
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,330
What are these round things?

113
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,960
Chocolate Marbles.

114
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,260
Was the guy's tattoo a hawk?

115
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,210
It was all muddled up, so I couldn't tell.

116
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,350
Actually, I've gotten a number
of texts since yesterday.

117
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,020
Kawafuji

118
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,770
I think that guy's my friend.

119
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,610
Since it fell into the sea,

120
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,020
Inbox

121
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,020
the keys are messed up, so I can't send a reply.

122
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,070
Never mind your phone...

123
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,350
What surprises me is you having a friend.

124
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,510
I'll hit you for that.

125
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,110
Sensei!

126
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,460
Oh, Miwa.

127
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,170
What's going on?

128
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,050
You really gotta ask?

129
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,230
These two...

130
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,650
Hey, you guys!

131
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,410
I said come in this way!

132
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,710
That's the front door!

133
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,160
Uh... it'd be better for me if
they entered through the front door.

134
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,660
Guests?

135
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,350
They're sayin' they're yer friends.

136
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,660
Hey!

137
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,090
Drunk

138
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,090
Kawa—

139
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,250
...fuji?

140
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,980
Why is he so drunk?

141
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,630
He was suspected of tryin' to kidnap
a child in broad daylight,

142
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,170
so they lectured him good at the village meetin'...

143
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,460
That is correct, sir!

144
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,980
But every time folks gather,
it turns into a drinkin' party.

145
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,840
No, I am truly sorry!

146
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,830
Ah, now I get it...

147
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,440
Handa!

148
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,140
I've been... so very worried about you.

149
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,870
A city boy like you, living in such a rural area...

150
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,530
What, you're crying now?

151
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,250
I was just so, so worried...

152
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,500
Kawafuji...

153
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,500
You care that much about me?

154
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,130
My Friend, Handa!

155
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,840
My Friend, Kawafuji!

156
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,710
My Friend Forever!

157
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,050
Kawafuji!

158
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,550
Handa...

159
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,220
Why, you!

160
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,920
How dare you ignore my calls?!

161
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,600
Are you fake?! A false friend?!

162
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,850
Sorry! My cell phone's broken.

163
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,990
Screw that! Find some other way to reach me!

164
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,440
Well... I thought you'd be able to make it here...

165
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,520
You forget how inconvenient the countryside is!

166
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,690
Why are you throwing up?!

167
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,290
Was it tough coming here from Tokyo?

168
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,570
With layovers, the flight took about three hours.

169
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,140
Wow. I don't know much about flying on planes.

170
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,180
I ain't been on one before.

171
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,260
Haven't you guys ever been to Tokyo?

172
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,840
Nope.

173
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,790
I've been to Nagasaki.

174
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,720
I've been to Hyougo.

175
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,060
Seriously? I can't believe it.

176
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,340
Sensei, we're outta konomon.

177
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,210
Go get more.

178
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,640
"Go get more"?

179
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,790
You think you can order your elders around?

180
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,370
It's yer house, so what's the problem?

181
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,100
C'mon, hurry!

182
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,780
You all get along very well.

183
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,330
Middle schoolers these days...

184
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,530
It don't seem like yer a friend of Sensei's...

185
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,440
Just taggin' along with the drunk?

186
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,120
I simply had to meet Handa-san.

187
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,700
This is who I am.

188
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,910
Kanzaki Kousuke

189
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,910
Kanzaki Kousuke, calligrapher.

190
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,490
I want a card, too!

191
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,660
I chose this career because of
my admiration for Handa-san.

192
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,660
Gimme one, too!

193
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,450
Wow, you look awfully young.

194
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,380
Me, too! Me, too! Me, too! Me, too!

195
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,730
I am eighteen.

196
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,380
I often get mistaken for a middle schooler.

197
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,670
Yay!

198
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,030
An eighteen-year-old calligrapher?

199
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,340
Feels like I've heard that somewhere...

200
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,100
Earlier, I worked up my courage and
entered the same competition as Handa-san.

201
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,510
It was the Tokyo Kasho Exhibition.

202
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,600
But I was so clueless,

203
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,060
I ended up taking grand prize from the one I admired.

204
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,770
I had always thought of Handa-san as above the
clouds, but he suddenly felt a lot closer to me.

205
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,910
Well, maybe Handa-san just
wasn't really trying that time?

206
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,260
Isn't he talking about that one?

207
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,410
From the mochi-gathering...

208
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,490
Yeah.

209
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,950
The Second-Place Calligraphy Incident.

210
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,260
What's a guy like that doin',
comin' to meet Sensei?

211
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,950
'Cause he wanted to see him lookin' mortified?

212
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,460
If Sensei were to learn his identity...

213
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,250
Is this enough konomon?

214
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,130
Oh! Handa-san, here's my card—

215
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,130
No!

216
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,030
What do you mean, "No"?

217
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,840
Don't we always eat this much?

218
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,490
We didn't mean the amount...

219
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,620
Also, that's too much!

220
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,960
You're hooked on the stuff!

221
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,810
Handa-san, you certainly are a funny one.

222
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,880
Hey, hey!

223
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,560
If he found out he lost
to such an obnoxious guy...

224
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,080
Sensei's got so much pride...

225
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,530
He could end up killing himself...

226
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,410
Handa-san, in that recent calli—

227
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,450
Hey, hey, look how late it is already!

228
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,530
That's right! You better get goin'!

229
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,920
Yer stayin' at an inn, right?

230
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,700
We stayed at the campground last night.

231
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,360
Oh, I see! Then you better
head back to the campin' village.

232
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,060
The road's dangerous at night.

233
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,960
Kawafuji's asleep anyway,
so just spend the night here.

234
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,330
Can we really?!

235
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,620
Thank goodness!

236
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,840
Go away, you!

237
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,320
I hated the campground. There were so many bugs.

238
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,720
And there's a lot I want to talk to you about.

239
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,250
What'll we do?!

240
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,110
He's rarin' to spend the night!

241
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,600
We'll have to spend the night,
too, and hold him off.

242
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,940
But I got a college advisin' session tomorrow.

243
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:47,940
What is it?

244
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,470
Any friend of Sensei's is a friend of mine.

245
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,480
I got club myself.

246
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,070
Here's a token of our friendship.

247
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,070
What is it?

248
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,100
Filthy Monster Ball!

249
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,530
What've you done?!

250
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,210
Waaah! My precious shield bugs!

251
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,210
Don't keep weird pets!

252
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,210
Too loud...

253
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,060
!

254
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,670
Get out!

255
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,130
Sensei, don't! If you excite them...

256
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,240
It stinks!

257
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,810
I tried to warn ya!

258
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,380
Hiro-nii!

259
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:18,880
Yeah!

260
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,050
Here!

261
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,410
There!

262
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,590
Usin' this, you can catch 'em
before they let off stink.

263
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,130
You guys sure know some
dicey underhanded tricks.

264
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,900
It came in real handy here,
so don't call it "dicey."

265
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,050
I'm sick of this!

266
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,320
I wanna go home!

267
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,330
Anyhow, you really should leave for today.

268
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,240
The stink'll be attractin' other bugs.

269
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,000
Well then, I'll be back tomorrow.

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,660
Sure. I'll be waiting.

271
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,120
Oh, Handa-san.

272
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,420
Can I... call you "Sensei," too?

273
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,710
Sure, if you want.

274
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,020
Crisis averted!

275
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,640
So that was Kanzaki Kousuke...

276
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,450
He doesn't look at all like a calligrapher.

277
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,800
But his nasty side kinda shows through.

278
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,160
Hang on a minute!

279
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,160
Hang on!

280
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,730
You knew who he was?!

281
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,660
From: Kawafuji
Sub: Answer your phone!

282
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,710
We're not acquainted,

283
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,660
but Kawafuji sent me a text.

284
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,070
"I'm bringing Kanzaki Kousuke, the kid who won
grand prize in the calligraphy competition."

285
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,290
"He's a bit quirky, so be ready."

286
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,600
See?

287
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,710
"See," nothing!

288
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,760
We were thinkin' you'd be all upset about it!

289
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,210
Oh, is that right?

290
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,880
Well, it's not as if I'm unbothered by it.

291
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,750
I do have some envy, too.

292
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,850
But I feel more at ease somehow.

293
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,510
Sensei...

294
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,090
Now, let's go catch the rest of the shield bugs.

295
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,100
Ayup!

296
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,020
I'm lost.

297
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,440
Sorry to barge in again today.

298
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,360
You okay with tea?

299
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,210
Oh, don't trouble yourself.

300
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,740
Kawafuji didn't come today?

301
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
Bright Camping Village

302
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,130
He has a terrible hangover and can't stand up.

303
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,920
Well, that's the thing about that guy.

304
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,920
In whatever he does, he has bad timing.

305
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,830
Drinking tea in this heat?

306
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,600
Black soy tea really is the best.

307
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,510
Did Kawafuji-san tell you anything about me?

308
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,730
Like how you won a grand prize
and let it go to your head?

309
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,590
What a mean thing to say.

310
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,620
I truly admire you, Handa-sensei.

311
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,310
Here, take a look at my collection.

312
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,310

316
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,660
I picked up every book I could
find that had you in it.

317
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:44,490

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,630
You're a genius calligrapher with

321
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,490
Cloud
Magazine

322
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,490
In every single book, your calligraphy is considered
beautiful and faithful to the fundamentals.

323
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,740
See your smug face in this pin-up?

324
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,410
Calligrapher
Handa Seishuu

325
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,410
You couldn't make an expression
like that without self-confidence!

326
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,600
And here's one of you in a suit.

327
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,040
Were you going for the impression of black ink?

328
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,920
Handa Seishuu

329
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,370
What is this?

330
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,920
It's extremely embarrassing...

331
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,500
Do you see now?!

332
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,580
You are who I aspire to be.

333
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,760
I especially treasure the comments that you made.

334
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,260
Cloud
Spring Sky

335
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,270
"As I inhale deeply of the refined air,
I address my paper and brush,

336
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,970
and they respond to me, affirmingly."

337
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,970
Stop!

338
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,510
Don't read that out loud!

339
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,550
"To me, calligraphy is

340
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,730
the act of luring myself into catharsis..."

341
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,910
What's "karta-sushi"?

342
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,400
Karta

343
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,480
Karta                                       Sushi

344
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,480
Shut up.

345
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,450
Don't console me wordlessly!

346
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,660
This one's even lovelier.

347
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,030
Stop The Humiliation!

348
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,220
Here's what I'll do!

349
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,790
That's mean!

350
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Who's being mean?!

351
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,650
You came to laugh at me, didn't you?!

352
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,110
N-No, I did not!

353
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,210
I wanted to hear your famous lines live.

354
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,420
I even brought a voice recorder!

355
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,630
Are you a maniac?!

356
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,380
And after seeing your entry at the Kasho
Exhibition, I knew I had to meet you.

357
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,600
What are you doing out here in the country?

358
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,570
Isn't the calligraphy you submitted to the exhibition

359
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,920
one that you wrote after coming to the island?

360
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,640
Sensei...

361
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,020
Come back to Tokyo with us.

362
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,820
Man, my head hurts.

363
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,240
Hey, what're you guys up to?

364
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,760
Sorry 'bout yesterday.

365
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,360
We came to see Kanzaki-kun...

366
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,490
He 'round?

367
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,240
Oh, he went to Handa's place.

368
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,080
What, already?!

369
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,530
What about it?

370
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,140
Did you come to warn him not to
say anything unnecessary to Handa?

371
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,710
Well, yeah, we did.

372
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,780
You're going to a lot of trouble.

373
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,060
It's no fun looking after an adult, is it?

374
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,720
We ain't particularly lookin' after him!

375
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,050
Say no more.

376
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,390
I know that feeling well.

377
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,800
Despite appearances, the guy's a real handful.

378
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,940
He's no good without somebody
supporting him from the shadows.

379
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,530
Handa and I have been friends since middle school.

380
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,990
He's always been bad at social interactions.

381
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,700
Are you some kind of idiot?

382
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,320
Anytime he opened his mouth,
he'd say something high-handed.

383
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,110
I'm just so...

384
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,160
He'd get depressed easily, and wall himself off.

385
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,160
A barrier?

386
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,790
And then, he even went and
punched a gallery director.

387
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,290
It's been tough covering for him...

388
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,290
How is it I can picture his school days so easily?

389
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,660
Since I'd pictured the countryside as a place
where associating with others was important,

390
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,930
I assumed that he'd give up
and come back right away.

391
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,590
He must be having a lot of fun, living here.

392
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,940
Could you look after him a little longer?

393
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,990
If ya know Sensei so well,

394
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,230
why'd ya come bringin' Kanzaki-kun?

395
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,170
Sensei was feelin' mighty down after
losin' the grand prize to him.

396
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,900
My head again...

397
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,910
Don't fake sick!

398
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,200
I'm an art dealer.

399
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,470
Before being my friend, Handa's a money tree.

400
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,770
"Money tree"?

401
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,380
So I'll be in trouble if he doesn't
produce good works, right?

402
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,750
Since he came to this island,
he's been searching for something.

403
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,560
But he's probably floundering,
not knowing what it is.

404
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,750
In order for a person to mature,

405
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,510
don't they need a rival?

406
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,430
Now then...

407
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,850
I've got a hangover, so I'll spend the day sleeping.

408
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,560
Tell Handa I'm coming tomorrow.

409
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,700
He does seem like you'd expect
a friend of Sensei's to be.

410
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,680
Lions smack their own cubs down into valleys.

411
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,070
Are they like that?

412
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,660
But first, how does calligraphy
have winners and losers?

413
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,660
It's not a martial art.

414
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,160
Please return to Tokyo, and do calligraphy
seriously again, like you used to.

415
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,000
Wait a minute!

416
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,420
I came to this island to boost
my skill in calligraphy.

417
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,920
I can't go back until I get results.

418
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,510
Results...?

419
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,700
What "results" are you talking about?

420
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,640
I'd done calligraphy since grade school,

421
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,980
but since it was just boring practice
day after day, I was planning to quit.

422
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,940
Ward Residents Art Center

423
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,940
At that time,

424
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,440
I reluctantly visited a calligraphy exhibition,

425
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,110
and saw calligraphy you had written.

426
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,740
"What pretty calligraphy!" I thought.

427
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,180
But now, you're not getting results.

428
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,370
You're getting worse.

429
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:58,950
Worse?!

430
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,090
Haven't you realized it?

431
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,290
It's like you're pointlessly attempting
to add too much individuality.

432
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,880
Your writing is just forceful.
It's not like you at all!

433
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,170
Really...?

434
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,590
The fact that you lost to me is proof of that!

435
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,690
Sure, I expected you to feel mortified,

436
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,630
but you have no idea how
much you're degenerating!

437
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,020
This environment is ruining you!

438
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,150
Wait a minute!

439
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,440
Let's go back to Tokyo!

440
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,350
Now, look...

441
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,290
Writing calligraphy people will
acknowledge is everything.

442
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,400
Aren't you the one who said that?

443
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,520
Your calligraphy is just plain dull.

444
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,280
For one still so young,
your calligraphy is highly conformist.

445
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,820
...better described as copybook-style...

446
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,830
Sensei, please, listen to me!

447
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,830
Did you even attempt to scale
the wall of mediocrity?

448
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,450
Instead of fussin' over that stuff,
I'd rather have fun writin'.

449
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,450
Let's go back, Sensei!

450
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,330
You can't stay in a place like this!

451
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,780
Acknowledged? By whom?

452
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,290
Sensei! Sensei!

453
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,110
Sen—

454
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,860
Shut up!

455
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,920
What do you want from me?!

456
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,870
I win a prize, but get told it's dull!

457
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,670
I write good calligraphy, but don't win a prize!

458
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,830
I don't know anymore.

459
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,300
I don't know what the correct answer is...

460
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,560
Paper airplanes?

461
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,520
My collection!

462
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,400
Who would do this?!

463
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,400
Amazing!

464
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,130
Your planes really fly great!

465
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,960
They fly when the wind blows.

466
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,280
Sensei!

467
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,290
Yer flyin'!

468
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,370
Quit messing around, kids!

469
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,170
Hey, say something, Sense—

470
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,130
Go on ahead.

471
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,870
My calligraphy that you call pretty

472
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,540
is well-behaved calligraphy,
written the way my dad told me.

473
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,800
I don't mind if you get mad.

474
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,390
I want...

475
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,810
to write calligraphy only Handa Seishuu can write.

476
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,050
I don't know what the correct answer is,

477
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,090
but letting your words goad me

478
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,030
into returning to Tokyo feels wrong.

479
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,400
I want to change myself.

480
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,500
Here.

481
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,770
Hey, you guys, that's dangerous!

482
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,990
Come down from there!

483
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,960
Ayup!

484
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,960
Okay!

485
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,830
Go on ahead and wait for me a little longer.

486
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,550
I'll catch up right away, riding on the wind.

487
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,000
Sensei!

488
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,680
Could you repeat those words once m—

489
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,510
Oh, crap!

490
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,260
That was a better hit than I expected.

491
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,750
Naru, go call the village chief!

492
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,780
Hina, you go get ice!

493
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,990
Ayup!

494
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,240
Too bad...

495
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,440
He's still got some growing up to do.

496
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
I'd better do my best, too.

497
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,240
Why's this guy at our house?

498
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,180
A lot happened.

499
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,110
Havin' a young man visit gives your
mother a reason to cook dinner.

500
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,960
Old hags shouldn't try for sex appeal.

501
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,210
I'm gonna knock yer block off!

502
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,210
Translation: I'll hit you hard enough to dislocate your jaw!

503
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,880
Oh! That's right, Sensei!

504
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,990
Earlier, Naru was distributin' these
magazines throughout the village.

505
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,020
Yer real famous, Sensei!

506
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,270
Uh, er...

507
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,950
Please autograph this.

508
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,820
Does your mother have a grudge against me?

509
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,480
Sorry, I guess...

510
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,190
But there's no way he'd have an autogra—

511
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,150
Oh, he does...

512
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,280
Uh... you said she was distributing
them throughout the village?

513
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,590
Sensei, we saw them!

514
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,190
I knew it...

515
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,730
These books're from a bookstore in Tokyo!

516
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,340
Gimme your autograph!

517
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,710
That's a real big deal!

518
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,170
I ain't got a signboard, so sign my T-shirt.

519
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,460
He ain't called Sensei for nothin'!

520
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,420
To me, calligraphy is...

521
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,470
As I inhale deeply of the refined air...

522
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,960
No! Stop it!

523
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,840
Luring myself into catharsis...

524
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,060
I'm going back to Tokyo!

525
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,980
Filthy Monster Ball!

526
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,570
Good evening.

527
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,860
Man 1

528
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,860
Don't keep weird pets!

529
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,450
Man 2            Man 1

530
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:26,820
Over there!

531
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,610
Too loud...

532
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,610
Man 3

533
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,010
Help me!

534
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,450
Man 4            Man 3

535
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,450
I'm going back to Tokyo!

536
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,750
Hey, Hiroshi! Hiroshi!

537
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,360
Isn't that dangerous?

538
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,210
Sensei, is it okay to let go?!

539
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,630
Their army...

540
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,510
is increasin'!
