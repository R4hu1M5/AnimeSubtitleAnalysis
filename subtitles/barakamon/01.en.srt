1
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,930
For one still so young,
your calligraphy is highly conformist.

2
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,800
I don't know if it's better
described as copybook-style,

3
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,470
or made simply to win calligraphy awards.

4
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,120
Did you even attempt to scale
the wall of mediocrity?

Eika Prize Award Reception

With all due respect, Director...

7
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,910
Managing the hall for many years
has given me a discerning eye.

8
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,860
And your calligraphy is just plain dull.

9
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,380
Say, I took these photos earlier...

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,430
Hey! Handa!

11
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,020
What's wrong with my calligraphy?!

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,880
What are you doing, you idiot?!

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,670
Let me go! He can't insult me like that!

14
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,580
He doesn't even know how hard I've worked!

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,290
Ow!

Yer lucky, sonny!

28
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
If I hadn't come by,

29
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,810
it mighta taken you more'n half
a day get to Nanatsutake Village!

Huh?

31
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,770
Mighta taken half a day's walk!

32
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,820
Uh, I can't understand what you're saying.

33
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,640
Huh?! Whaddya say?!

34
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,360
Huh?!

35
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,090
Huh?!

36
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,960
Ain't got no clue what yer sayin'.

37
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,380
Whatever. I'll just ignore him.

38
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,810
There's nothing here...

39
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,690
Look there, sonny!

40
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,440
It's th'sea! Th'sea!

41
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,220
"Th'sea"?

42
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,290
Oh...

43
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,840
What d'you think?

44
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,440
My grandkid sure loves th'sea.

45
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,210
Always a-squealin' with glee at th'sight.

46
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,570
What's to think?

47
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,950
It's just the ocean...

48
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,080
Maybe it doesn't look pretty
because my heart's gone hard?

49
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,170
Ow, my ribs...

50
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,640
This's as far as I take you.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,150
Gotta get to th'field.

52
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,750
Okay...

53
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,720
The sea not lookin' pretty to you, sonny,

54
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
ain't 'cause your heart's gone hard.

55
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,650
It's just 'cuz it gets cloudy in th'afternoon.

56
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,210
Oh... so that's it.

57
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,660
Th'sea's worth seein' 'specially
when your heart's gone hard.

58
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,270
You just don' see that.

Kijima Shipping

Handa-san!

61
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,860
Handa-san?

62
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,910
Handa-san! It's Kijima Shipping!

63
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,540
I'm here!

64
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:12,870
Huh?

65
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,980
Kijima Shipping!

66
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,110
That should be everything.

67
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,710
Uh, could you help me bring them inside?

68
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,430
Oh, our company doesn't do that.

69
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,790
Well, I'm off.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,710
Customer service turns lousy when
they don't have any competitors.

71
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,110
I was waiting for you.

72
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,340
Er, um...

73
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,250
Village Chief?

74
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,590
You've had a long trip from Tokyo, eh?

75
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,020
Here's your house key.

76
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,110
Does this place have no buses,
or trains, or anything?

77
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,640
A bus stops by once a day.

78
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,700
You can call for a taxi,
but there aren't many of them.

79
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,500
You can borrow my car when
you need to go to town.

80
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,770
At any rate, could you
leave me alone for a week?

81
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,740
I want to immerse myself in writing.

82
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,230
Sure, got it.

83
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,720
Here, let me try the key.

84
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,850
Take all the time you need for writing.

85
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,680
You won't have to worry about food, either.

86
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,900
Huh, that easily?

87
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,900
Um...

88
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,340
There's nobody living here, right?

89
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,110
Yeah, that's right.

90
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,560
It feels strangely lived-in, somehow.

91
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,080
Huh?

92
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,690
Shh!

93
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,160
You're... You're just imagining it, really.

94
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,130
Talismans?!

95
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,250
Oh, don't worry about them.

96
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,450
They're just talismans.

97
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,260
A pit toilet...

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,950
What is this?

99
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,450
Never used a balanced-flue
bath heater before?

100
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,680
You crank this to light the flame.

101
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,120
See?

102
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,500
I have to live in a place like this?

103
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,590
You all right?

104
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,430
I'm fine.

105
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,760
There's definitely something in here...

106
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,460
You found me!

107
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,880
Village Chief! Who is this kid?!

108
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,820
She's the village scamp.

109
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
Seems she's made this house her base.

110
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,800
Base?

111
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,080
Oh, more of a colony, really.

112
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,610
Uh, that makes even less sense.

113
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,810
I'm terribly sorry.

114
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,810
I told her to leave, but...

115
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,460
Hey, mister! You a Junon Boy?

116
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,110
Huh?

117
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,840
Naru! It's rude to ask questions like that.

118
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,960
But Miwa-nee was sayin',
Junon Boys look really cool.

119
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,410
This guy looks really cool,
so he's a Junon Boy!

120
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,690
That's not entirely incorrect,
but this man is a master calligrapher.

121
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,990
Oh! I get it, Village Chief!

122
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,850
He's a Junon Boy who can also do calligraphy!

123
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,340
No, that's wrong!

124
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,730
I still think he's a Junon Boy.

125
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,860
But he's past the age where
you'd call him a "boy," see?

126
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,860
Hey.

127
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,860
But don't people on TV claim
they're younger'n they are?

128
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,870
Miwa-nee said...

129
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:40,870
Hey.

130
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,830
Well, fudgin' numbers in their
favor may just be part of the job.

131
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,590
Oh! And "cowboys" are "boys"
even when they're old!

132
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,730
I'm sorry about that.

133
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,360
That child never listens.

134
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,430
Uh, could you leave, too?

135
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,100
He locked it?

136
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,240
Damn!

137
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,160
This is her "base," huh? Like hell it is.

138
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,290
But it's lucky for me that it already
has some semblance of living space.

139
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,950
I wanna write, too!

140
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,300
How did you get in here?!

141
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,630
Who does he think he is?
Just because he won a prize.

142
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,070
He punched the exhibit hall director.

143
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,370
Now he's basically dead
to the calligraphy world.

144
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,680
He has no manners.

145
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,910
Don't talk to him. They might
think you're like him.

146
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,560
Don't have anything to do with him.

147

148
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,080
Damn!

149
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,750
I keep getting distracted!

150
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,580
Is there a kettle in this house?

151
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,910
You gotta eat Corn Cones in stacks like this!

152
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,870
I've got metabolic syndrome,
so one at a time's plenty.

153
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,920
Hey.

154
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,840
Oh! Handa-sensei!

155
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,640
Want some finger-corn?

156
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,380
Roll, roll...

157
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,560
Yay! A new technique!

158
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,500
That's pretty cool, Naru!

159
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,920
Teach me how, too.

160
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,920
I can't do calligraphy like this.

161
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,550
Focus... focus... focus...

162
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,310
How?!

163
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,560

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,560
Look! Pretty good, right?

165
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,330
Did I say you could write anything?

166
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,430
Don't be so uptight, Junon Boy.

167
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,300
I told you, I'm not a Junon Boy.

168
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,390
Just like you have the
name "Kotoishi Naru"...

169
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,650
I have a name, too.

170
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,750
How'd you know my name?!

171
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,870
You a psychic?!

172
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,500
Are you really that stupid,
or do you think I am?

173
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,480
I know your name too, Junon Boy!

174
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,460
Well, good for you.

175
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,590
It's...

176
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,360
It's, um...

177
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,660
Village Chief was sayin' before...

178
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,910
By golly!

179
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,430
Pretty outdated cry of realization...

180
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,380
Junon Takeo!

181
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,890
Handa
Seishuu

182
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,200
Handa Seishuu.

183
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,810
Junon aside, where'd you get Takeo?

184
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,280
This's like a middle schooler's pen name!

185
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,610
That's "pseudonym"!

186
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,480
Amazin'! Your calligraphy's real good, Sensei!

187
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,250
It better be.

188
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,480
It's just like how my teacher at school writes.

189
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,940
Your calligraphy is highly conformist.

190
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,680
I don't know if it's better
described as copybook-style...

191
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,090
Your calligraphy is just plain dull.

192
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,300
Oh, right! For dinner, Village Chief—

193
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,560
What're you doin'?!

194
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,350
You worked hard to write that so good!

195
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,590
Shut up!

196
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,100
What do you know about my writing?!

197
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,960
Don't talk like you know anything!

198
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,030
Ow!

199
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,020
Hey!

200
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,870
I'm horrible...

201
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,090
What's a grown man doing, flipping out
whenever someone hits the bull's eye?

202
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,340
Huh? You're going to an island?

203
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,170
Why would you do that?

204
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,880
Dad said... I should go cool my head...

205
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,320
He said, "You're still flawed as a human
being, let alone a calligrapher."

206
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,930
What are you laughing about?!

207
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:38,900
Kawafuji
House of the Arts

208
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,870
You punched an old man who
uses a cane. You get no sympathy.

209
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,900
You could apologize, you know.

210
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,500
Like hell I will!

211
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,400
Dad and that man just don't get it.

212
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,970
What's wrong with being
faithful to the fundamentals?

213
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,620
Look...

214
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,030
Is writing calligraphy that way

215
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,250
any fun for you?

216
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,990
It's a given that the fundamentals
make the most beautiful writing.

217
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,550
I'm not wrong about that.

218
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,710
...the most important thing...

219
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,300
What's the most important thing?

220
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,310
She heard me singing?!

221
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,170
Well? What's the most important thing?

222
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,280
Well? Well? Well?

223
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,120
What do you want?!

224
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,150
I'm not going to apologize!

225
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,070
Why should you apologize?

226
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,610
I'm the one who was pesterin' you.

227
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,400
So anyhow,

228
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,540
I tried rewritin' your words.

229
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,540
But, I just couldn't write 'em the way you do.

230
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,350
I'm sorry!

231
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,310
Hey...

232
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,990
You didn't do anything wrong.

233
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,110
Then, you forgive me?

234
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,190
Yeah...

235
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,430
There's nothing to even forgive.

236
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,810
Thank goodness!

237
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,910
I'm so glad you forgave me!

238
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,880
I was mighty scared of apologizin' to you.

239
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,870
But now I'm really glad I did.

240
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,930
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

241
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,660
Hm?

242
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,860
Nothing!

243
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,120
Come on, get up.

244
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,800
Okay!

245
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,860
Still, you worked hard to write this.

246
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,560
Nah, it was easy!

247
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,730
You write just like the copybook!

248
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,790
What'd you do that for?!

249
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,440
Sorry, just a reflex.

250
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,710
Anyway, you don't even get why I was upset.

251
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,880
This is just practice calligraphy,
so it's meant to be thrown awa—

252
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,630
You did it to me first!

253
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,030
Huh?

254
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,550
Sensei?

255
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,510
Sen—

256
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,810
Don't go scarin' me like that!

257
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,940
I thought you up an' died!

258
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,080
I'm about to die in these heavy clothes.

259
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,780
That's the problem with you city folk!

260
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,610
When that happens...

261
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,740
Do like this!

262
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,100
What the heck?!

263
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,740
First, plug up the neck of your T-shirt.

264
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,840
An' catch a bunch of air under your shirt.

265
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,300
Then you just swim!

266
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,920
I'm impressed, in spite of myself.

267
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,160
Do you always swim in water this deep?

268
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,890
Yep!

269
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,440
The power of childhood is terrifying.

270
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,050
Hey, Sensei! I'm gonna show
you somethin' real nice!

271
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,560
Huh?

272
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,820
If you climb that there wall,
you can see a mighty fine sunset!

273
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,920
Hold on a minute!

274
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,630
You're climbing this bulwark?

275
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,160
Yep! Gotta climb to see it.

276
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,670
I don't need to see the sunset.

277
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,950
Look at the sky.

278
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,020
You can't see anything
through all those clouds.

279
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,380
You won't know 'til you climb up and see.

280
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,470
You don't try, you don't get to look.

281
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,470
Look out!

282
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,600
I'm all right. Just got in a hurry.

283
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,230
And I'm there!

284
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,150
Hurry on up, Sensei!

285
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,350
If you don't climb up here,
you won't get to see nothin'!

286
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,610
Did you

287
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,480
even attempt to scale the wall of mediocrity?

288
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,260
See?

289
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,650
Ain't it pretty?

290
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,280
Yeah...

291
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,640
It really is.

292
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,690
Yer back!

293
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,470
First Villager?

294
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,170
Grampa!

295
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,160
He's your grandfather?

296
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,150
That's right!

297
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,080
Hey, Sensei!

298
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,830
Better hurry on down or
I'll open yer boxes myself!

299
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,730
Huh?! Why?!

300
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,800
Yer movin' in, so I done come to pitch in!

301
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,360
"Pitch in"?

302
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,770
Yer from Tokyo?

303
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,560
That's a mighty long way.

304
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,180
We'll be lettin' ourselves in.

305
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,600
Uh, sure.

306
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,690
C'mon! You too, Sensei!

307
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,000
Did your grandfather call them over?

308
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,760
Huh? No, he didn't.

309
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,200
Ever'body saw the moving
van and came themselves.

310
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,420
Not many people move in 'round here.

311
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,230
But, they don't know me...

312
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,410
I can't make them do that...

313
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,500
My, what a fine young man.

314
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,280
Sorry we took so long.

315
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,620
Hina!

316
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,560
Sensei, lemme introduce you!

317
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,260
This's my friend, Hina!

318
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,230
Nice to meet you.

319
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,600
Hina's mighty shy, y'see!

320
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,470
So, I shouldn't talk to you, then?

321
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,700
What now?!

322
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,900
Looks like Hina wants you
to pay attention to her.

323
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,760
I see... Sorry about that.

324
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,490
Huh?! Why?!

325
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,200
Hina cries even when she's happy.

326
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
This is hard to deal with!

327
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,160
Butt jab!

328
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,120
You were wide open!

329
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,060
Hey! Kenta!

330
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,080
I told you in our class meeting
that butt jabs ain't allowed!

331
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,750
Shut up, stinky smoke-man!

332
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,340
Sorry 'bout that.

333
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,370
That punk won't shape up,
no matter what I tell him.

334
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,780
You all right?

335
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,970
I'm fine—

336
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,890
Who is this?

337
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,100
The head teacher at the branch school.

338
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,730
Hi.

339
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,690
Ahh, ain't nothin' funnier than seein'
a handsome guy gettin' disgraced.

340
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,320
Why, you...

341
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,740
Mind if we bring the boxes in?

342
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,150
Oh, sure.

343
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,420
Sensei, see you later!

344
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,620
Yeah...

345
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,170
Oh, hey, Kawafuji...

346
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,840
Yeah.

347
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:40,260
I kind of see the reason why
Dad had me come to this island.

348
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,450
If I write anything good,
I'll send it for display.

349
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,910
You can help out then.

350
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,200
Also...

351
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,530
Would you apologize to the director for me?

352
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,300
I was wrong, too...

353
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,090
Do it myself? No way, I can't do that yet...

354
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,250
On this island?

355
00:20:59,440 --> 00:20:59,940
Yeah.

356
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,950
FUN

357
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,820
I think I'll manage somehow.

358
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,360
Uh...

359
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,500
I brought...

360
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,690
some champon for you...

361
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,980
Scary...
