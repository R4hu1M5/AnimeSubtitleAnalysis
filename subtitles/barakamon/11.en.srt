00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,310
Sensei! I came to play!

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,980
Huh?

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,620
Sensei!

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,250
Huh?

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,360
Sensei?

6
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,300
Hey, you got here early.

7
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,900
Did you get my calligraphy?

8
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,720
It arrived ages ago.

9
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,560
STAR

10
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,560
Seishuu
Handa

11
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,020
As huge as it is, it sure looks grand.

12
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,560
Yeah.

13
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,190
STAR

14
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,340
Are you saying it wouldn't
look grand if it was small?!

15
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,930
That's how you took it?

16
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,220
Even if you're still an apprentice,

17
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,050
you're something of an art dealer, Kawafuji.

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,060
Are you only praising the size
because you don't know any better?

19
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,230
Or is the size the only
thing praiseworthy about it?

20
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,870
He's still a real pain in the ass...

21
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,800
Well, calm down.

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,540
The director should be here soon.

23
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,420
The d—!

24
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,490
M-May I please have a glass of water?

25
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,970
You're way too nervous.

26
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,240
Are you all right?

27
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,010
I Am in Tokyo

28
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,010
Translation:
Yoseo

29
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,480
What am I supposed to say to the director?

30
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,290
An apology, obviously.

31
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,120
You returned because he said he'd forgive you.

32
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,740
The rest depends on your state of mind.

33
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,670
For what it's worth, I bought a
cell phone strap to give him.

34
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,410
A cell phone strap? He's not
a high school girl, you know.

35
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,660
Exclusive

36
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,660
Baramon-kun

37
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,660
And these aren't cute at all.

38
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,300
If you keep sighing like that,

39
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,490
you'll bring me down, too.

40
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,930
The director is going to
look at my calligraphy soon.

41
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,440
What'll I do if he lambastes
it before I exhibit at Naruka?

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,590
I'll never be able to recover!

43
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't think he'll do that.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,610
You brought it because you felt
confident about it, right?

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,450
As someone who's known me
a long time, what do you think?

46
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,020
Would you be able to tell I wrote that?

47
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,790
STAR

48
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,790
Seishuu
Handa

49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,790
When you ask me that way,
I'm not sure how to answer...

50
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,230
Seishuu
Handa

51
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,120
STAR

52
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,120
But I think it's good calligraphy.
Very bold and eye-catching.

53
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,410
I never would've imagined you
writing anything like it before.

54
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,710
That's my point!

55
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,300
Huh?

56
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,680
I don't write calligraphy like this!

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,460
It's too good!

58
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,180
Sorry, but I don't get what you're trying to say.

59
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,900
How do I put it...?

60
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,470
It just doesn't feel right!

61
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,350
I mean...

62
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,260
It just happened! I don't know how I did it!

63
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,770
10 Minutes Later

64
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,140
In short, you're saying it's a fluke?

65
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,270
Don't put it so simply!

66
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,770
But that's exactly what it is, darn it!

67
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,740
Anybody could write something like
that if they went to the island!

68
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,510
There's nothing odd about that, is there?

69
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,450
You don't have to beat yourself up over
using a different style than usual.

70
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,750
You could just describe it as
"a little experimentation."

71
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,920
If I keep doing that, I'll never
find my own calligraphy style.

72
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,060
If you're studying to be a farmer,

73
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,430
going fishing on a whim and catching a
hisan iwo doesn't make you a fisherman!

74
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,390
I want to find my own flower
and raise it until it blooms!

75
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,120
A flower unlike any other in the world!

76
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,300
The one that was always my special "only one"!

77
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,190
Huh? What are you talking about?

78
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,270
Are you implying that you
don't have to be number one?

79
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,570
A farmer cannot become a fisherman, you say?

80
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,610
That's a very amusing analogy, Handa-kun.

81
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,350
Director!

82
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,620
With both calligraphers and artists,

83
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,010
the successful ones are those who
perfect their own idiosyncrasies.

84
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,370
I'm sorry I didn't come to see you in.

85
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,460
No, I came to meet with Handa-kun.

86
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,340
No need to trouble yourself.

87
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,220
Now, are you doing well?

88
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,450
Yes, very well, sir!

89
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,580
Oh, no need to be so formal.

90
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,300
You spoke more naturally with me before.

91
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,850
No, I went too far last time, sir!

92
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,350
Calm down, calm down!

93
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,520
I need to properly apologize and get his forgiveness.

94
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,530
A cane...

95
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,490
The director has a bad back.

96
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,150
Why, thank you, Handa-kun.

97
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,870
Don't mention it.

98
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,640
No matter how upset I may have been,

99
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,340
how could I have hit someone who's like this?

100
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,490
I'm a horrible person.

101
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,690
What I did was truly inexcusable.

102
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,700
I should have apologized much sooner.

103
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,790
Both for punching you,

104
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,530
and for returning once I
knew I would be forgiven,

105
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,450
I am truly...

106
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,850
I am truly very sorry!

107
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,660
Director...

108
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,240
The truth is, I wasn't planning on forgiving you.

109
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,610
I only said that to lure you back here,

110
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,920
so I could give you a long lecture on human morality.

111
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,380
But it appears that won't be necessary.

112
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,300
Just refrain from behaving
so impulsively in the future.

113
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,010
I forgive you.

114
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,930
Handa?!

115
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,110
Thank goodness...

116
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,490
I wasn't sure what I'd do if you didn't forgive me.

117
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,120
Truly, sir, thank you very much.

118
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,300
Good for you, Handa.

119
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,850
Now give him the cell phone strap.

120
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,210
You know this isn't the time for that!

121
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,180
Now then, Handa-kun.

122
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,870
Yes, sir!

123
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,610
I wish to see your calligraphy up close.

124
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,420
Could you lend me a hand?

125
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,990
R-Right!

126
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,020
STAR

127
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,980
So this is what you wrote
after taking time to mature?

128
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,650
Yes...

129
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,090
U-Um...

130
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,460
It's...

131
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,700
Uhh...

132
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,170
Handa-kun.

133
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,830
This calligraphy is—

134
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:43,230
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

135
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,950
And I just told you not to behave impulsively...

136
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,230
Don't laugh, don't laugh, don't laugh...

137
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,850
This calligraphy is a test work!
That's right! I drew it for practice!

138
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,820
My submission for the exhibition is still
packed up, so I couldn't bring it here!

139
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,370
I see!

140
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,070
True, it is unreasonable to expect to see
your work this close to the deadline.

141
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,490
Y-Yes, sir! I'm sorry that I showed
you this trashy calligraphy!

142
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,080
Hey, Handa...

143
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:09,250
Well then, I'll appraise this as a test work.

144
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,260
You've written something so interesting,
I wouldn't have recognized it as yours.

145
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,300
The character is one you'd see
in a grade school assignment,

146
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,310
but in it, I can see the stars of the night sky.

147
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,870
It shows the hopelessness of
being left behind in the dark,

148
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,490
along with the light that's only visible in darkness.

149
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,780
Although I wouldn't be the only one to judge it,

150
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,490
I would deem it worthy of a grand prize.

151
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,690
Thank you very much!

152
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,870
Now I really look forward to it.

153
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,950
If this is a test work,

154
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,250
then I should see some even more
wonderful calligraphy at Naruka.

155
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,980
This has been a most fruitful day.

156
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,490
I'll stop by again.

157
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,890
Oh, Director, let me call you a taxi.

158
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,730
Now I've done it...

159
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,520
Kawafuji House of Art

160
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,520
Director...

161
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,690
I don't need a taxi.

162
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,990
My ride is waiting for me.

163
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,110
Oh, I see...

164
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you very much for coming!

165
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,390
So he came by car...

166
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,210
Isn't that car...

167
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,430
It appears that sending Seishuu-kun
to the island was the correct decision.

168
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,140
He still has a long way to go.

169
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,970
Wh-What's wrong?

170
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm sorry, the engine stalled.

171
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,390
I'm not very good at starting up slopes.

172
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,890
We're both awkward,

173
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,370
my son and I.

174
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,410
I-I'm scared! I'm scared!

175
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,930
Hey, Handa!

176
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,040
It looks like your dad was...

177
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,540
Hey! What's wrong?!

178
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,020
Ship me back to the island...

179
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,150
Hello!

180
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,160
My, it's been quite a while, Kawafuji-kun!

181
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,560
Handa, I'm coming in.

182
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,450
You're late...

183
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,670
Guess I'll leave...

184
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,480
Don't run away, cold-hearted jerk!

185
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,080
Judging by how you look,

186
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,780
I'm guessing you haven't gotten anywhere.

187
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,420
Right.

188
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,670
What's that on your head?

189
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,950
An attempt to get back the
form you had on the island?

190
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,960
Right.

191
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,590
I thought it'd give me at least a little inspiration.

192
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,070
The deadline for the exhibition is tomorrow!

193
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,610
This isn't the time to be doing stuff like that!

194
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,150
Do you have to scold me like that?

195
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,070
I tried writing "Star" in the same way as before.

196
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,590
Yeah, with that flavor,
you could aim for grand prize!

197
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,860
If you wrote it the exact
same way, then it's a cinch!

198
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,620
STAR

199
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,620
Seishuu
Handa

200
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,440
Now it really is like a grade school assignment.

201
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,080
I knew you'd say that!

202
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,580
I tried to write it exactly
the same way, but I can't!

203
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,660
No matter how hard I stare at the night sky,

204
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,380
the city lights are too bright for me to get anxious!

205
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,260
I can't write! I can't! I can't!

206
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,380
That makes it this much different from before?

207
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:48,310
It turns out I'm more influenced
by my environment than I ever knew.

208
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,060
So you were only stable before

209
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,440
because you'd never had any
major distress in your life.

210
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,930
But you've always entered
exhibitions before, haven't you?

211
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,250
So make it work.

212
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,810
It's not that simple!

213
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,090
Would I bother calling someone like you
over if I could manage this by myself?!

214
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,870
"Someone like you"? How could
you say that to your only friend?

215
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,770
There's nothing I can do f—

216
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,610
Wrong!

217
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,320
There is but one thing you can do for me.

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,820
Wai—

219
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,740
Sei-san, the tea is ready.

220
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,100
What is the point of this, again?

221
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,980
Hold still! I can't tie it if you're moving!

222
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,370
Sensei, who am I supposed to be?

223
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,870
I don't even like children that much.

224
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,360
Shut up!

225
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,820
All you have to do is keep quiet and cry!

226
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,150
B-Bondage?!

227
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,830
Oh, might you be Sensei's mother?

228
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,950
Pardon the intrusion!

229
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,870
What? Mom?!

230
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,640
Sei-san...

231
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,580
What on earth are you doing?

232
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,190
Oh! This isn't what it looks like!

233
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,530
It's to help me write calligraphy!

234
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,570
Incidentally, Kawafuji-san is playing Naru-chan,

235
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,250
I'm telling you, it's not like that, Mom! Mom?!

236
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,550
while I'm a crybaby first grader!

237
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:18,060
Mother

238
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,460
He used to be a good boy.

239
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,290
Though never very sociable,

240
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,960
he was kind at heart, the type young people
would call "prickly-sweet," and beloved by all.

241
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,590
And yet, now he's become "prickly-stupid"?!

242
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,690
Neither part of that is lovable at all!

243
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,060
This is all because he went to that island!

244
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,110
Wait! Mom?!

245
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,260
That's not what...

246
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,850
You all right?

247
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,870
I'm not, but...

248
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,990
this just felt very reminiscent of the island.

249
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,620
But isn't it simplistic to
expect to write good calligraphy

250
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,350
just by reenacting things you did on the island?

251
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,580
Don't get in my bed!

252
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,200
Just ditch the calligraphy you could only write
on the island, and hurry back here to Tokyo!

253
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,590
Hey! Quit digging around!

254
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,920
I knew you had a porn stash!

255
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,520
Hey!

256
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,220
For real?!

257
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,600
Calligrapher

258
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,060
Don't throw it out!

259
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,610
If you're not in the exhibition, Sensei,
then I don't feel like doing it, either.

260
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,200
The prize money isn't all that much,

261
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,210
and it's not like it'd make me really famous.

262
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,820
Maybe I'll write a bunch and
hold a one-man exhibition...

263
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,880
Don't be ridiculous.

264
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,580
Do you realize how much I have
riding on this exhibition?

265
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,840
Sure, it's not a major exhibition.

266
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,370
But to me, it's a crucial first step
toward a new start in life.

267
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,920
I will definitely take that step.

268
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,510
Sensei...

269
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,600
Hey! What are you recording?!

270
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,310
My famous quotes collection!

271
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,470
Why did you call this kid over, anyway?

272
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,160
I thought just Naru wouldn't be
enough to bring out the mood.

273
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,160
Sensei!

274
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,740
He's irritating me!

275
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,250
Well, thanks to him,

276
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,200
now I can see how serious you are.

277
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,660
Here's some help from me.

278
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,940
A phone call?

279
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,240
Incoming

280
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,620
In Call

281
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,620
Hello?

282
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,580
Well? Is he on?

283
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,330
Sensei?

284
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,010
Oh, did he answer?

285
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,260
Sensei?

286
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,020
Sensei! You good?

287
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,360
Hey! Put me on, too!

288
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,010
Why are you guys...

289
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,610
He's on!

290
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,270
Hello! Sensei, you doin' good?!

291
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,450
Kawafuji-san asked us to talk to
you because you seemed lonely.

292
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,680
Hey, Akki! Ain't ya done talkin'?!

293
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,690
So we all gathered at the store.

294
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,480
Sensei! Are you well?!

295
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,360
Kawa-san may be nice,

296
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,110
but Hiro-nii is deeply worried about you, too!

297
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,170
Why're you talking like that?

298
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,280
Tch!

299
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,370
Hello?

300
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,200
Since you left without saying anything,

301
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,200
My turn!

302
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,130
it's been nuts over here.

303
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,130
Gimme it!

304
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,840
I see.

305
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,330
Sorry about th—

306
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,330
Sensei!

307
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,700
Are you doing well?!

308
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,260
Quit sayin' pointless stuff!

309
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,990
Or I'm gonna feed ya my fist!

310
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,860
What you need most are friends, right?

311
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,410
You should thank me.

312
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,820
Hey, me next!

313
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,310
Ow! Quit it!

314
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,600
In Call

315
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,600
You're on my foot!

316
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,600
Yeah.

317
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,010
Sensei! Are you well?!

318
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,380
Thanks.

319
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,650
He actually thanked me.

320
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,650
That hurts my ears! Take turns talking!

321
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,530
Sensei, yer comin' back, right?

322
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,490
When're ya comin'?

323
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,990
I thought up a good punishment for
ya leavin' without sayin' anythin'!

324
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,720
You guys...

325
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,690
This is Akki.

326
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,870
Hi, Akki.

327
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,460
I heard you were distressed over
not being able to do good work.

328
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,290
I can't believe how considerate you are.

329
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,420
Your consideration would put adults to shame.

330
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,550
I think I'll be fine, if I can stir up some
inspiration by remembering the island.

331
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,230
Yeah... Y-Yeah, yeah.

332
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,560
He's seriously discussing his worries with a child.

333
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,970
Well, I'm not exactly in a slump,

334
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,090
but when I need to write, I just can't do it.

335
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,860
I don't understand.

336
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,860
Hey! Tell me before you switch, you guys!

337
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,620
They're messing with him.

338
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,450
Looks fun.

339
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,150
Sensei...

340
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,080
Is this Naru?

341
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,790
Yep.

342
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,000
It's borin' without you here, Sensei.

343
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,960
There's still gobs of stuff I wanna do with ya.

344
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,500
An' so...

345
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,260
Please come home real soon.

346
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,890
We're waitin' for ya!

347
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,020
Think you can write now?

348
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,860
Yeah.

349
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,910
I think I had...

350
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,620
Sensei, are you looking for something?

351
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,990
Well, I'm not sure if I brought it with me or not,

352
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,920
but since it was from the last
job I did there, then maybe...

353
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,290
Here it is...

354
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,320
A list of names?

355
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,930
Ink...

356
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,510
Grind me lots of ink!

357
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,030
Kanzaki, go buy paper for writing practice!

358
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,600
Why do I have to do it?!

359
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,430
At last, he's taking action.

360
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,530
I just hope he doesn't do anything strange again.

361
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,400
I was against this from the beginning.

362
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,050
I don't want him going to that island again!

363
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,550
In that case, you should persuade him not to go.

364
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,890
You're so cruel!

365
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,980
He's already decided he wants to go!

366
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,070
Are you telling me to hurt him?!

367
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,120
You're so cruel!

368
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,870
Cruel! Cruel! Cruel! Cruel!

369
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:35,130
We also share the responsibility for
Sei becoming "all work and no play."

370
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,340
It's not for us to dictate
our son's direction in life.

371
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,890
If leaving here will allow him to grow,

372
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,310
then all we can do is watch over him.

373
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,350
Dear... If that's the path a man must take...

374
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,520
Whoa! It's Handa Seimei!

375
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,800
He's so dignified! So cool!

376
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,650
Will you quit it?!

377
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,300
Hey! Wake up, Kawafuji!

378
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,700
What time is it?

379
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,070
It's finished.

380
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,120
A work done using all my ability.

381
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,530
Well?

382
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,200
Isn't it incredible?

383
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,960
I've never done calligraphy like this before.

384
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,760
What's the title?

385
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,830
"Stone Wall."

386
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,900
I heard they've displayed our summer
vacation homework in the hallway!

387
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,030
Let's go check it out!

388
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,540
It's come...

389
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,030
Yes, the time has come.

390
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,500
I can't wait to see it!

391
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,290
I bet we'll win gold prizes!

392
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,250
Sensei would be so thrilled if we did!

393
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,780
Let's get double-gold and
give him a big surprise!

394
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,520
Sensei'd better thank God for
givin' him such capable disciples!

395
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,180
Yay!

396
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,880
Gold Prize

397
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,880
Class 2-1 Arai Tamako

398
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,550
Learning From the Past

399
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,550
Class 2-1
Yamamura
Miwa

400
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,550
Silver

401
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,970
Silver

402
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,990
Later, Miwa-chan.

403
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,690
I'm going to the restroom.

404
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,250
Why only Tama?

405
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,150
Miwa-chan, just snap out of it already!

406
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,230
It's all over...

407
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,460
I can't face Sensei now.

408
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,550
What's wrong with a silver prize?

409
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,800
It's still second place.

410
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,020
There's a world of difference
between first and second!

411
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,400
You're that mad?!
