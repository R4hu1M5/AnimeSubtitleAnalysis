1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,930
August

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,930
September

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,400
The role of the young

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,400
is to break new ground without fear of failure!

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,900
Break new ground, huh...

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,990
Feather

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,580
Okay...

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,160
Porcelain Spoon

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,210
Sensei!

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,950
What're you tryin' to do?

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,500
Rice Bowl

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,090
It's Naru's birthday?

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,130
Shh!

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,910
If Naru hears, it won't be a surprise!

15
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,680
We thought we'd all throw a party for her.

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,810
You're an adult, so contribute a thousand yen.

17
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:48,520
Happy Birthday

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,070
Party fees for a kid's birthday party?!

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,070
Not party fees. It's the cake fee.

20
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,520
We can't buy a whole one with our pocket change.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,980
Hiro-nii will bring the food this evening.

22
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,080
Sensei, you get a present for her, too.

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,900
A present?!

24
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,300
Cake! Cake!

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,660
Wait, I have to write today...

26
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,950
Feather

27
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,950
Rice Bowl

28
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,950
Porcelain Spoon

29
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,080
Well...

30
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,450
I guess that's enough for today.

31
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,660
Barakamon

32
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,010
Onde

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,010
Translation:
Buddhist Prayer Dance

34
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,840
Your present is...

35
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,130
a teddy bear!

36
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,390
It's a punching bag!

37
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,760
A ribbon!

38
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,140
Yahoo! It's perfect for
wrapping around my waist!

39
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,020
Look, a hand mirror!

40
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,400
Yay! Laser Beam!

41
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,400
Too bright!

42
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,100
None of those suit her.

43
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,590
What would she like?

44
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,800
Shut up, cicada!

45
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,330
All right, I got it!

46
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,500
I caught a cicada!

47
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,360
Kenta, got a moment?

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,420
Sensei?

49
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,900
Need somethin'?

50
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,640
Well...

51
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,340
I kind of need a favor...

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,980
This is the only present I can think of.

53
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,880
Could I have a rhinoceros beetle?

54
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,880
No way!

55
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,580
One! Just one!

56
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,770
I'll pay you ten yen!
That's a lot for a kid, right?!

57
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,230
Yer bein' a pest, Sensei!

58
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,690
This present's for Naru, right?

59
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,750
I'm givin' her rhinoceros beetles!

60
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,490
Just one won't hurt, right?

61
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,230
No!

62
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,860
Rustle...

63
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,540
I'm gonna give her a hundred
of 'em to make an insect bed!

64
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,860
That's more like a punishment.

65
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,720
Besides, I don't wanna give the
same present as someone else!

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,300
Well, that's true...

67
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,580
What are you giving her, Ichiro and Jiro?

68
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,400
Don't make up names for us!

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,750
We're givin' her sweets!

70
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,110
You've all thought on it.

71
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,200
You oughta think hard on it, too, Sensei!

72
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,920
I'll give her a stag beetle!

73
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,860
If you can catch that many rhinoceros beetles,

74
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,930
then a stag beetle should be even easier, right?

75
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,910
Lend me the net.

76
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,090
Bug catchin' ain't as easy as ya think, Sensei.

77
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,480
Heck, life ain't that easy.

78
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,220
You call it easy,

79
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,280
but they're tough to find.

80
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,330
That's because you're children, isn't it?

81
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,910
With my adult's height,

82
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,330
I can see higher up, so it'll be easy!

83
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,660
Sensei, yer gettin' real irritatin'.

84
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,240
Found one right away!

85
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,440
Aww, it's a female.

86
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,300
Hey!

87
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,750
I spotted it!

88
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,720
Yer too slow!

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,660
The battle ain't over 'til the beetle's caught!

90
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,960
What?!

91
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,360
If ya can't catch even one rhinoceros beetle,

92
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,380
Naru's gonna be fed up with ya!

93
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,530
So disappointed...

94
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,600
I don't exactly care, but I'm still irritated.

95
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,850
Kenta, there's one over here!

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,510
I got it!

97
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,020
I ain't gonna lose!

98
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,230
Yes!

99
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,070
I did it! I caught a rhinoceros beetle—

100
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,900
Wait, no I didn't! What is this?!

101
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,410
That's a drone beetle, doofus!

102
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,430
Sensei can't catch nothin'!

103
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,180
Let's go that way!

104
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,430
Yay!

105
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,010
You  kids!

106
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,700
I won't lose to you!

107
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,660
A greater stag beetle!

108
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,730
It's a bit high up.

109
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,630
All right!

110
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,630
Formation Beta!

111
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,260
Almost there...

112
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,090
Y-You're heavy...

113
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,950
I can't hold up!

114
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,010
Ow, ow, ow...

115
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,770
Where's Kenta?

116
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,340
What are you guys doing?

117
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,110
Sensei, you didn't leave yet?

118
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,220
Don't you mean, "Thank you"?

119
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,280
I can't leave without catching one.

120
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,610
With this, I'm unbeatable.

121
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,580
I can catch any bug, no matter how high up.

122
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,750
All right! I've got my present!

123
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,750
Sensei?

124
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,990
Can you lend me the net real quick?

125
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,250
You came bug catchin' when
you won't even touch 'em?!

126
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,920
You jerk! It might bite me,
or it could carry some weird disease!

127
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,930
They don't bite, and don't carry diseases!

128
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,140
Apologize to the beetle!

129
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,210
Up close, it's even more gross than I imagined!

130
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,090
Why is it so glossy?!

131
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,430
It's just like a cockroach!

132
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,520
They ain't the same at all, stupid!

133
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,120
Anyway, give me the net, now!

134
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,730
No!

135
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,960
I think it might've bit me!

136
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,190
Could a guy like this catch bugs?

137
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,120
Gah! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts, I think!

138
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,120
No way.

139
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,990
Amazin'!

140
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,040
Look at this, Kenta!

141
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,250
It's a Hercules beetle!

142
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,020
What's one doin' here?

143
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,440
Someone must've been
keepin' it, but it got away!

144
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,040
It wouldn't be here otherwise!

145
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,260
Why, is it really that amazing?

146
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,260
It's real amazin'!

147
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,950
They showed 'em on TV!

148
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,400
They cost 20,000 yen!

149
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,840
20,000 for a bug?!

150
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,970
Sensei, lend us the ladder!

151
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,100
We'll join forces to catch it!

152
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,890
Naru'll be thrilled to get such big game!

153
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,390
Yeah, really!

154
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,280
20,000 for a kid's present...

155
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,260
Carefully...

156
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,990
Go carefully, Kenta.

157
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,490
Yeah.

158
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,240
No good... I can't reach!

159
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,150
Sensei!

160
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,240
Me?! No, I can't, I can't!

161
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,200
Sensei!

162
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,330
We'll hold the ladder!

163
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,200
An' we'll let Naru know how good you did!

164
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,330
We'll give her the big game together!

165
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,840
We're beggin' ya, Sensei!

166
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,130
Sensei, go for it!

167
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,220
Go for it!

168
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,090
Keep goin', Sensei!

169
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,910
It's so gross...

170
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,680
Shut up! Just catch it, now!

171
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,010
I caught it!

172
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,270
We did it!

173
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,430
Hooray!

174
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,610
Wait! Hey!

175
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,190
Hercules!

176
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,830
Don't let go!

177
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,270
Hercules!

178
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,270
H-Hey!

179
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,800
How can ya fall twice in one day?

180
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,630
Yer clumsiness is a talent in itself.

181
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,820
I'm never trusting you guys again.

182
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,200
So, got the Hercules?!

183
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,170
Yeah.

184
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,740
I knew I couldn't let it get away,

185
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,570
so I held on tight to the net.

186
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,040
Yay!

187
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,320
Huh?

188
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,080
It ain't movin'.

189
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,240
It's...

190
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,910
dead...

191
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,800
It can't be dead!

192
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,830
You smashed it!

193
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,890
You're kidding!

194
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,230
I can't believe you smashed the Hercules!

195
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,530
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

196
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,070
Yer dyin' next!

197
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,060
You're that upset?

198
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,690
You'd say that because of some bug?

199
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,650
But we were gonna give it to Naru!

200
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,620
Don't cry! Sheesh!

201
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,080
Hurkules

202
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,080
I really am sorry.

203
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,680
Don't worry about it.

204
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,300
Here, Sensei!

205
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,890
I'll give ya one I caught.

206
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,880
Are you sure?

207
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,010
Yeah. 'Cuz you worked hard for Naru's sake.

208
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,150
I never met an adult who'd play
seriously like you, Sensei.

209
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,600
I'm gonna have gobs of fun this summer!

210
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,850
Me, too!

211
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,360
Me, too!

212
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,820
You guys...

213
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,110
Grab it from the back.

214
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,450
Like this?

215
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:15,860
Right!

216
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,350
I did it! I can hold it!

217
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,830
Now I'm one step closer to your level!

218
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,450
I never had any intention
of playing with you guys.

219
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,910
I just hate losing.

220
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,150
I'll be going at it seriously
from now on, so be ready!

221
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,070
What're you doin', dummy?!

222
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,310
Naru's Turning 7

223
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,310
My house...

224
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,770
Naru-chan
Happy Birthday

225
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,770
is set up for the party?

226
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,520
Yer late, Sensei!

227
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,190
How did you guys get into my house?!

228
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,610
You underestimate us.

229
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,440
How many years do ya think
we've used this as our base?

230
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,650
I have another of these,

231
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,890
so you can have this back.

232
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,030
Is that...

233
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,660
A duplicate key!

234
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,710
I went to the hardware store for a duplicate
bike key, and it was surprisingly cheap!

235
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,120
I made five of 'em.

236
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,540
I have one, too.

237
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,310
Huh? It's unlocked today.

238
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,500
Hiro! You too?!

239
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,140
Wait, if there are five of them...

240
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,960
Who has the last one?

241
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,340
I lost it.

242
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,280
Maybe while playin' in the hills out back?

243
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,830
Sensei, do you have a present ready?

244
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,500
Oh, right, a present...

245
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,560
I brought bubble wrap!

246
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,310
I picked up some peacock feathers.

247
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,730
You guys really know what makes Naru tick.

248
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,850
You got bubble wrap, Miwa-chan?

249
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,400
I thought about that, too.

250
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,470
But those feathers are great!

251
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,560
Really?

252
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,950
I shoulda tried lookin' around—

253
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,030
Naru's coming!

254
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,840
Oh, no!

255
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,830
Get ready, everyone!

256
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,350
This is my first time throwing a birthday party.

257
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,340
We couldn't have done it without you, Sensei.

258
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,890
Me?

259
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,980
Let's do this every year from now on!

260
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,960
Did I do something?

261
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,350
Shoot off the cracker when she comes in.

262
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,560
Hey!

263
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,590
Naru!

264
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,560
Happy Birthday!

265
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,130
Happy Birthday!

266
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,570
Oh, that's right! It's my birthday!

267
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,790
First, your present from Sensei!

268
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,200
Naru's Turning 7

269
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,200
Uh, no, I'll give mine later!

270
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,990
Don't say that!

271
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,950
Hey! Stop it!

272
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,420
Got it!

273
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,990
Here! From Sensei.

274
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,840
Ticket to do
anything you say

275
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,840
Cut Here

276
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,840
One
time

277
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,310
What is this?! A grade schooler's
Mother's Day present?!

278
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,310
And there's just one! So stingy!

279
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,300
Listen, you guys...

280
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,960
Naru, it's okay to be mad!

281
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,150
Ticket to do
anything you say
One time

282
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,660
Yes!

283
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,050
I'm frightened by how thrilled you sound...

284
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,870
Isn't that great, Naru?

285
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,620
I keep watering these sunflowers, even though
I have no idea who planted them or when.

286
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,760
If I left them alone, they'd probably
grow up fine on their own...

287
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,940
Climbing up there again?

288
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,340
You know that's dangerous.

289
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,410
Grampa's goin' on a grave visit.

290
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,500
He said to bring you along, Sensei.

291
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,550
Grave visit?

292
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,570
Yep!

293
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,000
Sensei! This way, this way!

294
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, right...

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,800
It's already Obon season...

296
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,060
Sensei!

297
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,860
Over 'ere, Sensei!

298
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,580
Good of ya to come!

299
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,680
Are you sure you want an outsider
like me at your family grave?

300
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,180
I hafta go to the fields,

301
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,630
so I was thinkin' I'd have you keep
vigil over the gravesite flame.

302
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,310
Firecrackers?!

303
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,800
That's gotta be bad omen!

304
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,920
That's normal 'round here!

305
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,080
Huh, a custom?

306
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,210
Well, take care of the rest!

307
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,080
See you later!

308
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,330
You're going already?

309
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,730
Naru knows the ropes, so just do as she says!

310
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,110
Now, off to the fields!

311
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,550
He just dumped it on me...

312
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,520
Kotoishi
Family
Grave

313
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,520
I've never made a proper grave visit before.

314
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,530
I don't know who's resting here,

315
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,110
but I hope you'll treat me well today.

316
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,390
Sensei, first ya gotta set the lan'ern.

317
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,030
The "lan'ern"?

318
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,210
See, those!

319
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,630
Ah, paper lanterns.

320
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,400
Lan'ern!

321
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,980
Now that you mention it,
all the graves have one.

322
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,660
Until this flame goes out,
we mustn't leave the grave.

323
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,450
These are candles that burn for two hours.

324
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,540
We need to stay here for that long?

325
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,460
I got these in case we get bored!

326
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,500
So you do that, too...

327
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,920
Mind if I pay a visit, too?

328
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,430
Oh! Yasuba!

329
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,970
I came to offer an incense stick.

330
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,460
I was friends with Naru's gramma, y'know.

331
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,270
Somehow or other, I managed
to live through this past year.

332
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,860
That's kinda depressing...

333
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,960
There, much obliged.

334
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,040
Sensei, ya must have it rough in this heat.

335
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,470
With an outsider like me here,

336
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,870
Naru's grandma probably can't rest easy.

337
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,080
That ain't so.

338
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,890
Just look at this candle.

339
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,550
See how the flame's dancin' up and down?

340
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,850
Yeah, it is...

341
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,090
That means her gramma's smilin' down on ya.

342
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,060
Have faith in yerself.

343
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,200
Guess I'll do my best, if it'll make
the master of this grave happy.

344
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,270
Ayup!

345
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,480
Do you have a lighter?

346
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,880
I have matches.

347
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,900
Fireworks again?!

348
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,170
They're parachutes!

349
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,110
Fallin' umbrellas!

350
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,780
Hey, they're coming this way!

351
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,430
I did it! Midair catch!

352
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,700
That's our Miwa-chan!

353
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,120
Running wild without regard
for anyone she's disturbing!

354
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,900
Man, it's hard to run in a yukata.

355
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,330
I wanna do it, too!

356
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,330
Sorry, those were the last fallin' umbrellas.

357
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,590
Let's do somethin' else.

358
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,160
C'mon, Sensei, give us some reaction!

359
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,500
You can't just ignore us!

360
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,800
That's foul play!

361
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,670
He's telling us to help?

362
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,630
Fine, we'll help, we'll help!

363
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,360
Stop giving us the evil eye!

364
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,510
So this is different from Obon in Tokyo?

365
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,840
Completely different.

366
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,230
For starters, we don't visit in the evening,

367
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,090
and we don't offer uncooked rice.

368
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,990
We also don't set off fireworks,
or wear yukata, or hang paper lanterns.

369
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,450
You don't?!

370
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,460
Kotoishi
Family
Grave

371
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,510
The gold gravestone lettering is strange, too!

372
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,460
Yer kiddin'! They ain't
gold everywhere in Japan?!

373
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,260
Well, since I rarely make grave visits,

374
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,210
I can't exactly talk like I'm
an expert on the customs.

375
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:54,080
Well, we only come to visit
graves during Obon, too.

376
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,450
And we really only come to set off fireworks.

377
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,350
Oh, and to see the onde.

378
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,280
Onde?

379
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,630
Pardon me...

380
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,190
D'ya mind if we proceed past your gravesite?

381
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,870
That's the onde. They dance at each family
grave that's had a death since last Obon.

382
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,400
They're kinda scary...

383
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,160
What does that mean, translated into Japanese?

384
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,590
It ain't exactly a foreign language.

385
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,310
What's this? Why'd he stop?

386
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,900
Also, isn't he looking my way?

387
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,620
He is looking at me!

388
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,610
Have I done something wrong?!

389
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,610
You should see the look on your face!

390
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,770
Sensei, you frighten too easily.

391
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,580
Hiro?!

392
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,920
You're in the troop, too?!

393
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,170
They were shorthanded, so I'm filling in.

394
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,460
Hiro-senpai!

395
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,320
We have to hurry to the next one!

396
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,250
My feet are killin' me.

397
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,720
Just three more. Hang in there!

398
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,760
Later, Sensei. I still have dancing to do.

399
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,610
Sure. Good luck.

400
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,630
Don't follow me!

401
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,130
Why not?

402
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,230
I want to watch you dance.

403
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,230
Sensei's gradually starting to fit in here.

404
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,230
He's totally actin' as Naru's guardian.

405
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,840
I've tried to avoid thinking about it much,

406
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,120
but didn't Sensei come here because he
punched someone eminent in calligraphy?

407
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,880
What if his punishment were lifted?

408
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,080
Tama...

409
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,310
Finished your summer homework yet?

410
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,310
Well, to a degree.

411
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,570
Lemme copy it!

412
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,760
Miwa-chan...

413
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,960
Ah! Yer late, Sensei!

414
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,050
Fireworks! Fireworks!

415
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,940
It's smoky...

416
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,390
Heya, Sensei.

417
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,100
Mind if we offer incense?

418
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,980
Village Chief?

419
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,400
Naru's gramma took good care
of us while she was alive.

420
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,450
Oh, from Kinoshita General Store.

421
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,570
Mind if I offer incense?

422
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,050
Please, go ahead.

423
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,330
Hey! Miwa!

424
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,750
Why'd you leave our gravesite
alone to goof off here?!

425
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,830
Geh! Dad!

426
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,840
Sensei, tell him ya made me come here!

427
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,920
You're nuts! No way!

428
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,490
Sis, what are you doing?

429
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,400
Mom's been looking for you.

430
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,420
Aki...

431
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,930
How did you know I was here?

432
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,070
Mom told me to take
incense to Naru's grandma.

433
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,930
May I offer some this year, too?

434
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,930
Sure!

435
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,240
Naru's grandma is really popular.

436
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,470
Yes, she is.

437
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,650
Each year, people take turns paying her a visit.

438
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,890
Since Naru's grandpa is busy,

439
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,210
until now, Naru's had to keep
vigil over the flame by herself.

440
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,200
Come to think of it,
I've never seen Naru's parents...

441
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,440
Sensei! A pinwheel!

442
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,620
Hey!

443
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,080
Today's been more fun than usual!

444
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,550
Give me a break, you brat.

445
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,370
It was always boring waiting
for grampa to get back,

446
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,070
but today I don't wanna leave.

447
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,510
Then spend the night here!

448
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,600
I bet I know why.

449
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,020
It must be 'cuz you're here, Sensei.

450
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,960
I wanna play, too!

451
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,610
I never realized it since she's
always with someone...

452
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,140
But she gets lonely just like anyone else.

453
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,000
If I left her alone, she'd probably
grow up fine on her own...

454
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,230
Yay!

455
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,360
But maybe I'll look after her when I have time.

456
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,080
The flame went out.

457
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,520
It's already time to leave?

458
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,710
The vigil went by fast.

459
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,470
We're goin' now?

460
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,400
Your grandpa hasn't come back yet.

461
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,200
So I'll extend it.

462
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,890
All right!

463
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,760
Sensei's so sweet!

464
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,510
Shut up!

465
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,450
Gramma!

466
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,710
I'm gonna keep playin' here!

467
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,860
You're that happy?

468
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:16,810
Oh!

469
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,780
Look, Sensei, look!

470
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,260
Gramma's smilin' too!

471
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,840
Heya, Sensei.

472
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,030
Pooch-san!

473
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,080
Did you come here to fish for dinner?

474
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,160
Dogs don't eat crayfish.

475
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,390
You're looking like one of the locals,
fishing at the lake like this.

476
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,140
Oh, no... I'm still learning.

477
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,830
The villagers seem to like you too, Sensei.

478
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,770
Why not move here permanently?

479
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,310
I'm afraid I can't do that.

480
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,480
I see.

481
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,280
Well, when there's a place
that accepts you as you are,

482
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,440
don't you feel like it's safe
to attempt the impossible?

483
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,570
Pooch-san...

484
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,940
Treat me to lobster once you're
a big-shot calligrapher!

485
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,550
So you do eat crayfish!

486
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,780
Don't tell the shopkeeper, okay?

487
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,260
That's what he said in my dream.

488
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,650
It was just a dream, but it still made me happy.

489
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,240
Huh...

490
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,240
Pooch is female.
