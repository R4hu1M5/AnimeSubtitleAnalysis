1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,440
Yeah, it's finished.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,670
I'll mail it within the week,
so make sure you get it.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,520
I'm truly glad that I could
write good calligraphy.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,090
Ever since I came here,
I've had all kinds of inspiration.

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,990
The energy of nature is amazing!

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,680
Unlike in Tokyo, I have fun writing here.

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,500
Hey, are you listening, Kawafuji?

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,120
In Call

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,120
Hey!

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,210
You're here early, Director.

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,540
Thank you for taking the time to come.

13
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,270
Is his writing coming along well?

14
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,800
Her certainly talks like it is.

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,380
Rather than producing the same
beautiful writing as someone else,

16
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,080
I want Handa-kun to master calligraphy
that only he could write.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,960
Art that instantly brings him
to mind when you see it.

18
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,560
Who can say?

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,000
Personally, I'd like to have him back sooner,

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,350
but it seems he doesn't intend to return
until he gets results at an exhibition.

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,130
Does he feel remorseful about hitting me?

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,950
I can't really say.

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,960
If my forgiveness will persuade him to return,

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,960
then maybe it's time we have him come back.

28
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,270
Darn that Kawafuji!

29
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,270
Doesn't he even care to listen to me?

30
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,650
I was talking big to Kawafuji,

Kawafuji House of the Arts

32
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,080
but is this really the one I should submit?

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,800
I think it's good calligraphy,

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,910
but on the whole, it feels like
it was done on a whim.

35
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,080
Can I really call this calligraphy mine?

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
If it's calligraphy I could only
write because I came to the island,

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,340
I don't know for sure if I could
write the same way in Tokyo.

38
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,310
Crap... now I'm worried.

39
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,760
Even though it's an exhibition
that won't reject my work,

40
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,340
should I really submit a piece I wrote on a whim?

41
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,300
Think positive, positive!

42
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,440
It won't do any good to brood over it now.

43
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,350
Right now, my only weapon
is the inspiration of nature.

44
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,600
If I anguish over whether it's "my"
calligraphy, the deadline will...

45
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,720
Naru, what do you think?

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,860
Huh? 'Bout what?

47
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,580
Let's talk about what to play instead!

48
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,870
"Instead"?

49
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,490
I'm not playing with you.

50
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,700
I'm a proud guy, and I'm asking for your opinion.

51
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,430
Ya sure ya wanna say that?

52
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,230
Flash.

53
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,160
Ticket to do anything you say.
One time.

54
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:49,970
Shoot!

55
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,160
I should've given her a ticket for
a shoulder massage instead.

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,590
So long as I have this, ya hafta do what I say!

57
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,860
No, I wrote "one time" on it.

58
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,250
Grampa!

59
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,760
Naru!

60
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,710
What are they doing?

61
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,270
We're pilin' up stones to make a wall.

62
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,850
It's a typhoon barrier.

63
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,680
Ya gotta fit the stones together
just right, or it'll fall apart.

64
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,240
So it's like a puzzle!

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,690
Okay, try placin' a stone.

66
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,720
Is he trying to casually talk me into helping?!

67
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,630
Sensei's huntin' for toads with me!

68
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,910
I'm usin' this!

69
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,870
Toads?!

70
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,910
Ticket to do anything you say.
One time.

71
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,160
In that case...

72
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,750
I'll use this to get him to help me all day.

73
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,470
Sure, that I can do.

74
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,710
Hey, that was mine!

75
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,500
I'll give ya somethin' nicer, Naru.

76
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,690
Somethin' nicer?!

77
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,590
What d'ya mean?!

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,850
Here.

79
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,850
What's this?

80
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,180
It's a perfect skippin' stone!

81
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,640
Isn't that nice, Naru?

82
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,730
Forget it!

83
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,590
Good one...

84
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,230
C'mon and help, Sensei.

85
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,940
It's... heavy...

86
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,840
Take 'er over there.

87
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,030
Tch!

88
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,280
Let's see, I'll set this...

89
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,120
Like so...

90
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,880
It's a real thrill when it fits perfectly.

91
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,420
Yeah, ain't it?

92
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,760
Yer real good at this.

93
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,230
I just may be suited for this kind of precise task.

94
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,620
The ones we piled up look a right mess,

95
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,390
an' I thought we'd done good.

96
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,310
Yer real bad at this, Grampa!

97
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,960
And yer too honest!

98
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,880
While we're at it, how 'bout we have
Sensei handle that thing at the shrine?

99
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,530
Oh, right, that.

100
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,820
What thing?

101
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,080
C'mon in.

102
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,530
Pardon the intrusion.

103
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,130
What am I supposed to do here at the shrine?

104
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:02,630
Purification?

105
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,510
Here, look at this.

106
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,180
These're the names of ev'ryone who
donated when the shrine was built.

107
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,640
It's pretty much all the villagers from back then.

108
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,220
I was thinkin' it was 'bout time we got it rewritten.

109
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,800
Here, take this.

110
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,730
It's the village register.

111
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,890
I'd thought of askin' someone
in town to handle the job,

112
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,820
but you'd do it better, right?

113
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,680
Take this.

114
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,410
Wow, this is amazing.

115
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,530
It's an antique.

116
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,310
It won't be much,

117
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,240
but we'll give ya a little somethin' as thanks.

118
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,480
I don't need any money.

119
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,800
Ain't up for it?

120
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,040
It's not that.

121
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,250
I was just thinking that it's been a while

122
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,100
since I wrote such orderly calligraphy.

123
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,170
Write some good calligraphy again.

124
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,430
There's room for one more name here.

125
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,820
So that people know who wrote it,

126
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,810
how 'bout you add yer name, Sensei?

127
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,190
Should I?

128
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,530
I didn't donate anything.

129
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,530
Shh!

130
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,790
That'll be just between us.

131
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,270
Then I shouldn't...

132
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,150
Sensei!

133
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,900
There's a phone call for you at the store.

134
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,550
It's from Kawafuji-san.

135
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,700
That guy, after ignoring me earlier...

136
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,680
Here, take these to the house.

137
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,400
Sure.

138
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,140
Why'd Kawafuji call?

139
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,250
He said it was an important discussion.

140
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,930
What's an important discussion?

141
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,570
Grown-up talk.

142
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,220
What's wrong, Naru?

143
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,840
My ticket to make him do anythin' I say...

144
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,870
I hadn't asked him anythin' yet,

145
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,100
but then Grampa used it!

146
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,690
That's too bad.

147
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,010
What were you planning to ask him to do?

148
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,150
Lessee...

149
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,570
I wanna go with Sensei to the festival,

150
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,290
and to the beach again,

151
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,100
and to the sports meet, too!

152
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,410
Oh, and hiking, too.

153
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,410
And then...

154
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,150
For things like that,

155
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,690
I think he'd agree even if you didn't use a ticket.

156
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,290
Oh, yeah!

157
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,290
That'll be fun!

158
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,240
In that case, let's plan on goin' to the festival!

159
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,880
I wanna wear a kimono!

160
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,020
Okay, let's invite Miwa-nee and Tama, too!

161
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,270
It'll be a pain with those two around.

162
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,830
Yer goin' too, right, Akki?

163
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,530
Yeah!

164
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,170
Yeah.

165
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,800
I see.

166
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,900
Yeah, got it.

167
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,720
I'll come home.

168
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,490
All right!

169
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,240
Learning From The Past

170
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,240
I'm going with this one!

171
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,610
Learning From The Past

172
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,610
I'll use this!

173
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,670
Indeed.

174
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,280
You've done well to endure my
long training and come this far.

175
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,550
I have nothing left to teach you.

176
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,960
You both are certain to get gold prizes!

177
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,480
Yeah!

178
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,230
I tried to sound enthusiastic,

179
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,030
but will I really be okay?

180
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,600
After I wrote it with so much fighting spirit,

181
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,770
what if I don't get any prize at all?

182
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,390
Now I don't want to turn it in.

183
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,720
You dummies!

184
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,520
I taught you!

185
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,930
Your calligraphy is as good as anyone's!

186
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,870
Ya really think so, Sensei?

187
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,090
In fact, I'm more worried about myself.

188
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,130
I don't really know if the work
I chose to exhibit is good or not...

189
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,240
Sensei!

190
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,350
Sensei, take us to the festival!

191
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,620
You promised!

192
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,890
There, all set.

193
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,450
You actually know how to dress
someone in a yukata? I'm impressed.

194
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,210
It's so cute!

195
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,470
This stuff is easy.

196
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,240
I could even dress you in a real kimono.

197
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,090
Wow...

198
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,870
You're coming to the festival too, right?

199
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,550
Yeah.

200
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,890
C'mon! Let's get goin'!

201
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,930
Festival, festival!

202
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,140
Okay, we're goin' too, so see ya there!

203
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,310
Thanks for the lessons!

204
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,810
Sure.

205
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,580
C'mon, Sensei!

206
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,770
Hurry up!

207
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,820
All right, already!

208
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,720
A festival, huh...

209
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,610
I guess I'll go for a change of pace.

210
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,950
Ya look happy, Sensei.

211
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,800
I-I'm not happy about this or anything!

212
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,200
Hey!

213
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,540
Festival!

214
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,920
Well, why not?

215
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,650
After all, it's my last day here.

216
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,510
Gotou Bus Business Office

217
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,970
Gotou Bus Business Office

218
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,970
Yay! Festival, festival!

219
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,940
Heya! What'll ya have?

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,560
Tonme Festival

221
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,500
Sensei! This way!

222
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,570
So this is a festival...

223
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,990
I hardly ever went to any while I was in Tokyo.

224
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,780
Grade School

225
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,820
Sei-san, let's go to the festival!

226
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,780
No. He has a calligraphy exhibition.

227
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,540
High School

228
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,740
Handa, let's go to the festival!

229
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,540
Sei-san has a calligraphy exhibition. Sorry.

230
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,710
University

231
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,300
Handa-kyun, let's go to the festival!

232
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,590
Handa has a calligraphy exhibition.

233
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,040
I'll go instead.

234
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,980
It hurts to remember.

235
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,990
Especially since it's right before another exhibition...

236
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,220
Sensei!

237
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,720
Hot Dogs

238
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,720
Goldfish Scooping

239
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,720
Sensei! Goldfish! Goldfish!

240
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,930
That's the "Goldfish Scooping" I've heard about!

241
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,600
Oho, yer here, Sensei!

242
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,440
Crayfish      Goldfish

243
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,000
It's the gangst— er, I mean, Miwa's dad.

244
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,550
I'm helpin' out the commerce
and industry association.

245
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,290
Huh, sounds like a lot of work.

246
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,790
Okay, one hundred yen!

247
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,430
Seriously?

248
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,530
Can you really scoop with this?

249
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,130
Do yer best, Sensei!

250
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,160
Yeah!

251
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,100
Now!

252
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,170
Huh?

253
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,880
Yer bad at this, Sensei.

254
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,650
Sir, isn't this scoop defective?!

255
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,640
That ain't so. Yer just bad.

256
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,920
! One more time...

257
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,330
Sensei, could you move aside for a moment?

258
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,390
Oh, you're the nurse.

259
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,880
It's Iku-nee!

260
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,330
For this, you can't make a big splash.

261
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,860
Just watch Iku-chan's slick moves.

262
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,580
I-It's...

263
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,370
as if the goldfish are asking to be scooped!

264
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,250
Goldfish Scooping

265
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,250
Oh! It's Iku!

266
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,330
She's amazin' as always.

267
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,340
Iku-chan comin' by puts me in the red.

268
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,140
Though there ain't no way
she needs this many fish...

269
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,800
True...

270
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,170
Now for the last spurt!

271
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,960
Iku!

272
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,610
What're you doin', Aiko?!

273
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,110
Iku-chan, this's no good.

274
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,710
Ah! I was 'bout to set a new record!

275
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,320
Ikuko lays waste to the goldfish
scoopin' every single year.

276
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,020
The teacher!

277
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,250
"Ev'rything in moderation,"

278
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,400
I always taught her at the branch school.

279
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,490
Huh, you don't say...

280
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,500
I think he wants me to point out something,

281
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,850
but I'll ignore him...

282
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,370
You couldn't catch any goldfish.

283
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,850
It's a lot of work taking care of a pet,
so I decided not to catch any.

284
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,670
Somethin's goin' on there!

285
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,480
What could it be?

286
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,830
It's a free-throw competition.

287
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,590
It's Akki!

288
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,800
Akki!

289
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,300
Teams of four can win festival tickets
based on the number of points they make.

290
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,090
We're playing, too!

291
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,160
The brats!

292
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,180
We're on the same team.

293
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,980
If not for the middle schoolers
blinded by their greed for tickets,

294
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,260
we would be certain to take first place.

295
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,110
First place is 5,000 yen!

296
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,890
Let's show 'em that the
softball team is invincible!

297
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,470
Okay, Miwacchi!

298
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,900
The air around them is dead...

299
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,250
Hey, isn't Tama with you?

300
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,410
Oh, Sensei!

301
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,490
Tama went to buy a manga that came out today.

302
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,290
We hafta have four people to do this,

303
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,760
so I wish she'd get back soon!

304
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,430
It's the Sensei we've heard about!

305
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,420
Wow, what a hottie!

306
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,250
Nice shot, Akki!

307
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,290
That Akki's awful brazen for a sixth grader.

308
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,500
Akki's got pretty high specs,
despite his appearance.

309
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,930
We're up next! What's Tama doin'?!

310
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,980
She's late!

311
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,440
Meanwhile, Tama is...

312
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,590
Why isn't it here on the release date?!

313
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,440
Ain't it always like this?

314
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,290
Next, the Softball Glasses Team!

315
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,480
This's bad, Miwacchi!

316
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,660
Please come forward.

317
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,560
Ah! That rotten glasses girl!

318
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,330
Sensei, help us!

319
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,470
You just hafta get one shot in!

320
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,710
Just get one in? It's not that easy!

321
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,760
Okay, first shot!

322
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,710
There!

323
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Second shot!

324
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,300
Third shot!

325
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,720
You guys are too good at this!
Aren't you on the softball team?!

326
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,890
It's 'cuz we help out with the
basketball team sometimes.

327
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,900
There ain't many people,
so there's plenty of give and take.

328
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,790
Rural clubs are incredibly flexible...

329
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,390
Here!

330
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,940
C'mon, get goin', Sensei!

331
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,190
Huh? For real?!

332
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,680
Do I have to do this?

333
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,950
Do yer best, Sensei!

334
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,410
I never thought this day would come,
when I would reveal my hidden talent.

335
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,660
Yes, long ago, I...

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,460
read a basketball manga!

337
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,020
The winner is the Akki Squad!

338
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,770
They did well for grade schoolers!

339
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,560
Very impressive!

340
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,040
Sensei, cheer up.

341
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,180
No...

342
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,800
I thought I could do it...

343
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,140
Here, Sensei!

344
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,100
It ain't much, but second place got us tickets,

345
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,740
so here's your share: 300 yen.

346
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,860
Can I really have this, even though I missed?

347
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,280
It's Tama's share, but since she ain't here...

348
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:34,240
Meanwhile, Tama is...

349
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,930
I asked you to reserve me a copy!

350
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,150
Why'd you sell it?!

351
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,730
We'll get another one soon.

352
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,240
What the heck?!

353
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,450
Takoyaki
Yakisoba
Cotton Candy
Drinks

354
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,200
What do you want to eat?

355
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,850
I'll buy you anything you like.

356
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,450
Yay!

357
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,200
I'll have takoyaki!

358
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,410
Yakisoba!

359
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,650
You're getting cotton candy.

360
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,710
Cheapskate!

361
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,010
Ya just said you'll buy anything!

362
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,730
Don't assume all grown-ups have money!

363
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,160
Forget it, I'll buy my own.

364
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,290
Me, too.

365
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,090
You kids have money?!

366
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,680
And you're flaunting it!

367
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,580
If ya want somethin', say so!

368
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,110
I'll buy it for ya!

369
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,010
Stop it!

370
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,140
I can't have a seven-year-old
child spending money on me!

371
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,690
Just let her treat you.

372
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,650
Hiro!

373
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,790
Why don't you get the yakisoba?

374
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,680
It'll go towards the baseball club.

375
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,240
I do have some money...

376
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,020
But I'll just use these tickets
to get three cotton candy.

377
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,240
He really is a cheapskate...

378
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,370
Here's a nice big one.

379
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,870
All right!

380
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,460
Here.

381
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,350
Yay!

382
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,520
Here you go, Sensei.

383
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,610
Thank you!

384
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,380
Thanks, Sensei!

385
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,340
So this is cotton candy...

386
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,030
Where do I start eating it from?

387
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,300
Here? Here?

388
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,810
Here? No, maybe here?

389
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,650
Will Sensei be all right in that crowd?

390
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,380
I hope he doesn't get cotton candy on anyone's
clothes, or hurt himself with the chopsticks...

391
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,780
Hiroshi, I got more yakisoba!

392
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,740
Tonme Festival

393
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,700
Festival

394
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,060
The drum's real loud!

395
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,540
Real loud!

396
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,520
The fireworks display will begin at nine o'clock.

397
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,200
She said there's fireworks, Sensei!

398
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,780
Yeah.

399
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,610
Be careful not to get lost, you two!

400
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,520
Oh!

401
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,520
Hey!

402
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,740
Sensei, this way!

403
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,200
Right after I said...

404
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,800
Naru!

405
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,370
Hina!

406
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,880
, it's dark.

407
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,000
Sensei...

408
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,310
Tama, what are you doing?

409
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,380
Reading the manga I bought.

410
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,590
Well, I don't like crowds,

411
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,130
so I spend every summer festival like this.

412
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,770
Not that I'm one to talk,
but you're wasting your youth.

413
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,850
Have you seen Naru and Hina—

414
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,030
That's too bright!

415
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,910
Since they took this road,
they went to the beach.

416
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,000
It's time for the fireworks,
so let's go together.

417
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,510
There's a good little-known spot.

418
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,580
Oh! Sensei came!

419
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,550
Tama, where'd ya go?

420
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,710
Oh, sorry. I was reading manga.

421
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,330
Huh? Where are the softball team girls?

422
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,920
They're watchin' the fireworks
with their boyfriends.

423
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,190
Oh? I wish they'd blow up.

424
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,960
Tama?!

425
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,420
Oh! Here's Naru and Hina!

426
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,680
So you came too, Hiro-nii.

427
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,500
No girlfriend?

428
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,850
If I had one, I wouldn't be cooking yakisoba.

429
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,970
Sorry. I know, but I asked anyway.

430
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,150
Well, we've got the usual crew here.

431
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:47,930
Yeah.

432
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,990
Summer break's almost over...

433
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,040
This year sure was fun.

434
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,300
After school starts, there'll
be a lot less time for fun.

435
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,130
Ya studyin' for exams, Hiro-nii?

436
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,370
No, job huntin'.

437
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,620
By "job," do you mean one on the island?

438
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,120
No, off.

439
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,960
Aww, that's sad!

440
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,120
Well, there's still some time.

441
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,200
Yer right.

442
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,790
And even without you here,
there'll still be Sensei.

443
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,170
Ya sayin' Sensei can take my place?!

444
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,090
Listen...

445
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,800
There's something I have to tell you.

446
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,100
It's started!

447
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,450
Eek! It's too bright!

448
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,150
Wow!

449
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,150
Amazin'!

450
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,440
Hey...

451
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,250
What was Sensei tryin' to say just now?

452
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,120
Who knows...

453
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,090
Take a good look at him.

454
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,200
Even without words,

455
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,580
Sensei's back speaks volumes.

456
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,290
Sensei! I came to play!

457
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,760
Huh?

458
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,430
Sensei!

459
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,140
Huh?

460
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,080
Sensei?

461
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,860
Ain't nobody comin'...
