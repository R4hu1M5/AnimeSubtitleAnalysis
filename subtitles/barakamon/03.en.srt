1
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,990
What happened...?

2
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,620
Pu-Re-Mi-A-Mu...

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,910
Chiyo-Ko-Re... To.

4
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,540
Woah! You actually read it!

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,790
That was amazing, Naru!

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,750
Mandom.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,150
Mandom?

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,830
By mastering the katakana syllables we were
supposed to learn after summer vacation,

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,810
I've become a little more adult.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,100
Everything appears beautiful to me.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:47,560
Congratulations! Congratulations!

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,880
Is this what it means to grow up?

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,560
I sense the world's blessings
upon my newly-attained self.

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,200
Mandom.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,730
Where did she pick that up?

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,650
Okay, let's try one a mite harder.

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,570
Goto Milk

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,320
Here! Can you read the arrow?

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,320
Akekuchi
(Open Here)

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,820
It says, A-Ke..."Ro."

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,840
Woah, yer amazing, Naru!

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,000
You don't learn that kana 'til
third term... or even second grade!

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,940
Since you read it right,
this milk's yer prize.

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,790
Thank you.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,310
Go show everyone how you can read that kana!

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,840
Children really do grow up fast.

27
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,840
But I never thought she
was that into studying.

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,150
What suddenly motivated her?

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,890
Three guesses, first two don't count.

30
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,060
Oh, right...

31
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:29,940
What...

32
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,710
...happened to you?

33
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,610
Sensei, can you read this?

34
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,610
Mimei Market

35
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,190
It says, "akekuchi."

36
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,700
Barakamon

37
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,960
Hitonmochi

38
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,960
Translation:
Mochi Thrown in Celebration

39
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,570
Yeah, I just mailed it off.

40
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,300
Submit it to the Tokyo Kasho Exhibition.

41
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,010
Sure. Feeling confident?

42
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,770
This is my current self's calligraphy...

43
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,480
Light-Hearted

44
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,470
I wouldn't send it if I wasn't confident.

45
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,480
Can't wait to see it.

46
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,680
Oh, right.

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,080
I'm all out of ink.

48
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,310
Hiro?

49
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,030
Where can I buy ink?

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,890
Kinoshita General Store?

51
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,280
Good t'see ya...

52
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,530
Thanks for helping me move in.

53
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,090
Take yer time lookin'!

54
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,100
There's just about everything here.

55
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,390
Cheap candy... They never let me eat
any as a kid, since it was bad for me.

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,020
With Naru coming over to play,
I should have some on hand.

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,270
Naru likes Kanro hard candy and Choco-Bats.

58
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,480
Is she psychic!?

59
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,860
Squid on a Stick

60
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,650
Maybe I'll buy some in bulk...

61
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,720
Good, then other kids gonna come...

62
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,090
What's this thing?

63
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,950
It's cheap, so a peek wouldn't hurt.

64
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,980
Oh, crap!

65
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,240
What are these?

66
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,040
Needles?!

67
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,800
Augh! Sorry, I'll pick them up!

68
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,040
That's all of them.

69
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,640
I'll pay for it.

70
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,130
Oh, no no.

71
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,230
You done swept the floor for me.

72
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,400
Can't bend over lately
on account of back pain.

73
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,050
That was mighty helpful.

74
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,800
Isn't it because you're
carrying that poodle?

75
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,260
No, I can't say that.

76
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,450
'Scuze me.

77
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,920
Oh, hello.

78
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,730
Mighty hot out there!

79
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,880
Good t'see ya!

80
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,670
Bad back a'mite bettah?

81
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,670
Translation: Is your back doing well?

82
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,630
Wha' you a'heah foah?

83
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,630
Translation: What did you come to buy?

84
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,600
Translation: Do you have any thread(ito)?

85
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,850
Translation: Yes, it hurts(ita).

86
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,770
Translation: Do you have any thread?

87
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,730
Translation: Yes, it hurts.

88
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,190
Translation: Doesn't it hurt?

89
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,980
Translation: Yes, it hurts.

90
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,320
Uh, by "ito" you mean this, right?

91
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,100
Yeah! Thassit! Thassit!

92
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,660
I was askin' for those.

93
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,370
But she kept sayin' "itaka", "itaka"!

94
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,550
Ol' biddy heah got right bad eah'swell.

95
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,920
Translation: The old hag has bad ears too.

96
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,920
I don't know what you're saying.

97
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,990
Why're you gettin' so angry?!

98
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,780
Oh, right, ink.

99
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,680
Many-Many Ink Drops

100
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,980
I'm sorry. You ended up letting me take it.

101
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,230
It's okay.

102
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,870
I can always grind an ink stick.

103
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,860
This does help, I have a deadline soon.

104
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,010
That's right, I remember
about you drawing manga.

105
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,580
Oh, no!! My work is nothing that great.

106
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,330
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

107
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,960
We both know about the fun
of drawing and writing.

108
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,620
Let's be friends.

109
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,460
Um!

110
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,650
Would you... please read my manga?

111
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,250
I plan to submit it to a boys' magazine,

112
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,640
but I would like to hear
someone's frank opinion first.

113
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,550
I'm no expert on manga, so I
couldn't give you any pointers.

114
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,570
I don't mind!

115
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,360
I asked because it's you.

116
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,480
I want someone who knows the fun
of drawing and writing to read it!

117
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,640
I welcome your feedback.

118
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,970
Okay, if you insist.

119
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,710
Isn't that a striking introduction?

120
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,050
Is this for a horror magazine?

121
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,290
No, a boys' magazine!

122
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,620
Is there something odd about it?

123
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,960
Not exactly...

124
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,970
Splort

125
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,800
Shouldn't it have more of the
usual boys' magazine stuff?

126
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,800
The one whose name
is written bursts apart?

127
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,800
I'll call it the
"Snuff Note."

128
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,930
Like friendship, hard work...

129
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,260
Are you crazy?!

130
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,110
If I sent in a typical "honor and justice"
manga, nobody would read it!

131
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,830
Blood! Flesh! Entrails exploding!

132
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,280
The righteous getting crushed!

133
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,630
A protagonist on the dark side!

134
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,690
A complex bromance with a close
friend who's actually the enemy!

135
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,700
A heroine who naturally fades
out after just one chapter!

136
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,410
But, children will be—

137
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,490
Society demands story elements
it has never seen before!

138
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,160
Yes! Like having the heroine's best
friend's grandpa as the final boss!

139
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,630
W-Well, considering the current
trends, I guess it's a good manga—

140
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,760
Please read it to the very end.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,610
Then give me your impressions!

142
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,010
If it's no good, tell me!

143
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,360
Be honest, even if you don't
think I can handle the truth!

144
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,350
But...

145
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,560
You don't really want to hear it!

146
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,590
Read these to understand manga.

147
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,730
I'm not getting involved
with manga artists ever again.

148
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,030
Many-Many Ink Drops

149
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,670
I'd only told Miwa-chan that I planned
to be a manga artist someday.

150
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,320
But then I got carried away and
even showed him my manuscript!

151
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,260
What'll I do if Sensei tells
the villagers about it?

152
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,730
Unlike Naru...

153
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,730
Tama does manga!

154
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,810
...he'd have actual credibility!

155
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,650
The whole village will find out I'm a geek!

156
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,330
A complex bromance with a close
friend who's actually the enemy!

157
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,040
A heroine who naturally fades out!

158
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,190
They might not just think I'm a geek...

159
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,700
Fujoshi (Rotten Girl):

160
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,490
Fujoshi (Rotten Girl): a woman who prefers
novels and manga that depict male-male romances.

161
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,160
They'll think I'm a fujoshi!

162
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,030
Fujoshi (Rotten Girl): a woman who prefers novels and manga that depict male-male romances.
Related: BL (Boys Love), Yaoi, Fudanshi(Rotten Boy)

163
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,160
Fujoshi (Rotten Girl): a woman who prefers novels and manga that depict male-male romances.
Related:  BL (Boys Love), Yaoi, Fudanshi(Rotten Boy)
Formula: Girl Who Likes Manga ≠ Fujoshi

164
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,590
That can't happen!
I just love manga, is all!

165
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,360
My interests are purely literary!

166
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,250
I'm not some vulgar fujoshi!

167
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,600
I must make that clear...

168
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,660
Here. I made today's dinner too.

169
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,920
Oh... thanks again.

170
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,160
Something happen? You don't look so good.

171
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,520
No, just thinking about how girls
these days can be really passionate.

172
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,300
And how I have to grind
all my ink from now on.

173
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,730
It's got me down...

174
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,090
Oh! So you couldn't buy ink? Thought so.

175
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,230
"Thought so"?

176
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,550
They have penmanship homework for summer
vacation, so ink sells out right away.

177
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,490
So...

178
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,030
I brought you this worn-out
bottle we had at home.

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,450
If I don't clear up the misunderstanding,

180
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,420
and get falsely accused of being a fujoshi,

181
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,850
I'll no longer be able
to live in this village.

182
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,810
I'll tell him, "When I said I wanted to be
a manga artist, I really meant a novelist."

183
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,890
Could I have mistakenly lent
him my most secret book?!

184
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,890
Overtime Lovers
Sandro Tamura
"Huh? You're still here?!"

185
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,690
It happened my first year of middle school...

186
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,960
Tama, you got some manga
from one of your cousins.

187
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,520
Yay! All right!

188
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,440
Tama sure does love manga.

189
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,780
What is this? Two men doing that?! Ewww!

190
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,240
Now I'm traumatized for life!

191
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,990
That's filthy, stupid!

192
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,370
Grown-ups are all dirty!

193
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,960
Peek...

194
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,670
So that I'd never forget what occurred
that day, I've secured that manga!

195
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,540
I keep it separate from the others,

196
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,360
so I couldn't have
accidentally lent it out.

197
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,640
In any case, I must protect my
reputation as a proper, literary girl!

198
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,390
Sensei!

199
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,410
Ah, thanks for that.

200
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,940
I didn't expect my foot to slip...

201
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,040
Okay, okay, just get your
balance back already!

202
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,890
I was so happy about the ink,
that I got a little dizzy.

203
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,040
You're gonna conk your
head and die at some point!

204
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,210
Wait, the champon!

205
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,210
What?!

206
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,690
Huh?

207
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,770
Huh?

208
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,040
You've brought champon a lot lately.

209
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,620
What am I doing over here?

210
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,950
We got noodles as a midsummer gift.

211
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,320
I must finish my manuscript.

212
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,780
Manuscript...

213
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,380
Manuscri...

214
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,120
Manu...

215
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,090
Man...

216
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,820
Stupid, stupid adolescence!

217
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,730
Huh?

218
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,160
What do you mean?

219
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,430
That writing was a masterpiece!

220
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,160
There's no way it could've failed to win!

221
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,090
You're kidding, right?

222
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,100
Sensei! Let's play!

223
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,970
What's with this stagnant air?

224
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,980
What the heck's that?

225
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,200
What's wrong, Sensei?

226
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,840
Yer makin' gloom-fumes.

227
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,110
What's he mutterin'?

228
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,570
Sensei says he got second place
in the calligraphy contest.

229
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,090
Oh yeah... he was talkin' about
bein' in a calligraphy exhibit.

230
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,850
Ain't second place still pretty great?

231
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,940
He says, first place went to
an eighteen-year-old newbie.

232
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,850
What, yer sulkin' 'cause you
lost to someone younger?

233
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,720
That's all?

234
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,720
"That's all"?!

235
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,300
Do you know how much time and
energy I put into that writing!?

236
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,480
I even went without sleep to finish it!

237
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,350
But I've fallen behind some guy who
started calligraphy only yesterday!

238
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,150
I thought I'd be able to write good
calligraphy if I stayed on this island.

239
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,550
But now I'm paying for having taken it easy.

240
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,870
I never should've come to this stupid place!

241
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,020
Now wait, Sensei!

242
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,230
Miwa-chan!

243
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,200
Sorry, Sensei.

244
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,570
Looks like our timing was bad.

245
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,790
We'll come back later.

246
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,670
Why didn' you give him what for?

247
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,580
He even said we were holdin' him back!

248
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,700
Sensei has a lot of pride,

249
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,220
so using logic on him will
just make him more depressed.

250
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,710
Let's leave it to Naru.

251
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,050
Sensei.

252
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,740
Didn' Miwa-nee and Tama
leave unhappy with you?

253
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,680
Yes, I know!

254
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,810
Even middle-school kids worry about me.

255
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,270
I really am pathetic.

256
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,560
Still, it's just so vexing.

257
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,740
Without calligraphy, I have
nothing of value to offer.

258
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,300
But since I didn't win, I'm worthless.

259
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,830
Sensei, are you havin' fun right now?

260
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,320
If you ain't, then let's go play!

261
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,050
Everyone's carrying grocery bags.

262
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,370
What's going on here?

263
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,830
Mochi-picking!

264
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,700
You don't know 'bout it?

265
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,010
Yup, yer a stranger.

266
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,760
Hmph!

267
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,770
That's the thing where you toss
mochi after building a house, right?

268
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,980
I've never done it, but
I still know that much.

269
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,950
A house?

270
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,400
Big Catch

271
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Today's mochi-picking's for a boat!

272
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,270
I'm gonna pick a bunch!

273
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,460
Yer mighty late, Sensei.

274
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,660
Get ready, they're throwin' soon.

275
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,330
Uh, what's this for?

276
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,540
Kenta-folks' new boat.

277
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,100
"Kenta-folks"?

278
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,000
Hey! Naru!

279
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,880
Kenmaru

280
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,130
Kenta! That's a mighty fine boat!

281
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,880
'Course it is! It's called "Kenmaru"!

282
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,350
"Kenmaru"?

283
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,100
It's actually good luck to name
a boat after the eldest daughter.

284
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,970
But we ain't got no daughters.

285
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,940
I'm gonna toss a ton yer way, Naru!

286
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,940
Sensei! Over here!

287
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,060
Darn it!

288
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,440
Naru, look! I got mochi!

289
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,610
Fisherman

290
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,450
What're you doin', Kenta?!

291
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,340
I just... I just...

292
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,330
That's enough, just get scoopin'!

293
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,580
Oh! Sensei came too!

294
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,210
Feelin' a mite better?

295
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,010
You came too, Hiroshi?

296
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,910
Yeah. I was studying, but
these guys dragged me here.

297
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,510
After he shrewdly grabbed a glove.

298
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,630
If I'm doing anything,
I'm doing it seriously.

299
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,200
Ain't gonna lose, huh?

300
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,390
Hey.

301
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,350
About before... uh...

302
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,360
What? That still got ya down?

303
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,570
Don't worry none 'bout us.

304
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,040
Let's just focus on pickin' mochi.

305
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,250
In order to get a lot, you must keep
away from the two professionals.

306
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,450
"Professionals"?

307
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,450
The first one is Yasuba!

308
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,200
She has long years of
mochi-picking experience.

309
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,000
She always picks the most.

310
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,060
The other one is Panchi!

311
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,500
She'll snatch mochi you've already
picked, so stay 'way from her.

312
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,270
Beyond that, we just have to show our stuff.

313
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,290
Sensei!

314
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,340
I'm doing it too?

315
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,660
We're throwin'!

316
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,980
We're pickin'!

317
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,630
Yeaaaah!

318
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,440
Yeah.

319
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,810
Get set!

320
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,900
I got a late start.

321
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,450
I'll go up front to make a catch...

322
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,040
What just happened?

323
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,790
! I'll try again!

324
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,210
Yes! Now's my chance!

325
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,400
Sorry, Sensei.

326
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,010
You... took my mochi...

327
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,390
Grr! Is God testing me?

328
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,850
Tama?

329
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,330
Don't take it easy.

330
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,800
Go at it with your usual guts, Sensei.

331
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,980
What do you mean, "my usual"...?

332
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,910
So in the end, it's the same here too, huh?

333
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,880
Some can get them, and some can't.

334
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,710
Rather than struggle, wouldn't it be
more gracious to stop trying altogether?

335
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,720
Maybe I'll just quit...

336
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,740
...calligraphy...

337
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,860
you, Panchi!

338
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,340
Get anythin', Sensei?

339
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,270
Uh, no.

340
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,020
Maybe yer just bad at it.

341
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,900
I really am no good.

342
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,320
At anything.

343
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,820
It's no good if yer always lookin' up.

344
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,400
Wait patiently...

345
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,020
And take it once it hits the ground.

346
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,290
You find a mess of
opportunities fallen below.

347
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,290
Below...

348
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,130
Ain't many left now, but keep tryin'.

349
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,720
Yasuba!

350
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,090
What should I do if I still can't get any?

351
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,130
There's some guy better than me,

352
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,340
so what if I can't pick mochi at all?

353
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,890
Uh, well...

354
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,230
At such times...

355
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,970
Say, "Go on ahead."

356
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,380
Let 'er go, and try for a plumper mochi.

357
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,990
Never quit yieldin' and pickin'.

358
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,490
And see what y'get!

359
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,660
Sensei!

360
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,170
Hurry 'fore they're all gone!

361
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,290
All right!

362
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,550
You ready?

363
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,960
Let's do it!

364
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,430
G-Go ahead.

365
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,190
Was that really for the best...?

366
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,460
Sensei, how many did you pick?

367
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,960
Don't ask, Naru.

368
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,820
He didn't pick a single one.

369
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,450
I picked a whole twenty-eight!

370
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,780
Meanwhile, the grown man got zero...

371
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,110
No! I really did pick one!

372
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,200
It's just that Panchi—

373
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,210
Liar.

374
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,590
What's this?

375
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,770
Sweet-bean soup?

376
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,480
Yeah, that'd be Panchi.

377
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,510
She goes berserk during mochi-pickings,

378
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,670
but afterwards, she drops off food like this.

379
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,100
She gets a lot to distribute them to people
who couldn't make it to the picking.

380
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,620
Even so, don' lose next time.

381
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,360
This mochi's all wet!

382
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,770
That's one Kenta dropped...

383
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,330
So's one of mine!

384
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,280
Even with failure...

385
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,590
today was kinda fun for me.

386
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,810
Thanks, guys.

387
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,430
Told ya!

388
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,090
Yer catchin' crayfish too?

389
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,380
Oh! Schoolmaster!

390
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,100
You don't look at all like an educator.

391
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,000
Schoolmaster, you observin' crayfish too?

392
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,130
Nah, why would I?

393
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,060
I use 'em as bait for rock snapper.

394
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,870
No!

395
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,610
What're you doin', Naru?!

396
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,740
Usin' crayfish as bait's mean!

397
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,200
Naru, if you allow it, you can eat snapper.

398
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,740
You'd like some, right?

399
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,050
Then, let's catch crayfish.

400
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,810
Yeah! Let's fish!

401
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,650
Schoolmaster, how d'you use them as bait?

402
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,000
Well, first...

403
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,000
You pull off their claws, like this.

404
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,960
No!

405
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,150
Hey! Naru!
